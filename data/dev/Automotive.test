The mounting brackets for these lights SUCK. The lights are pretty bright but I have no use for it since I can't mount it nicely.	1
I used this product about an hour ago. The foam is much to soft and will not reach the areas it should. It does not polish well at all. Grab your rags, polish, tin foil, and a can of elbow grease, do it by hand and you will be a lot happier.	1
I ordered this for a 2008 Honda Civic.This valve will not screw into the oil pan, because the spot where the plug is located is recessed, and the valve can't turn in that space.	1
I read the directions fully before starting the work, followed them completely, and I ended up with a scratched lens after using the sandpaper.  I used plenty of liquid as well in case anyone thinks I put dry sand paper to a dry lens.  I would definitely not recommend using this product.	1
These were easy to break and they did not fit my 2008 Honda Civic.  The description of the product needs to be changed so people don't end up buying this and it doesn't fit their vehicle.	1
Terrible quality. These towels leave behind tons of lint and immediately began to become threadbare. After only a few months and limited use most of these towels are destroyed.	1
I love royal purple - but no difference - wish Castrol GTX still made theres, that was a difference!	1
I order this core remover and got a cheap piece of junk. The one sent was silver and did not even have the non slip end on it.I NOTIFIED AMAZON on THIS ITEM.	1
I have used this product in (3) vehicles, (2) lawn mowers, (1) grass trimmer, (1) snowblower and a partridge in a pear tree. I haven't noticed any benefit in using this product whatsoever. For fuel storage, I would recommend STA-BIL 360.	1
Would not connect from my 2005 Dodge Ram Diesel to a Toshiba A100 or a Tmobile G2 with the Torque app.	1
Used a new tire glaze with these applicators. The black color from the sponge bleed onto my hands. Shape and size of the applicators required two swipes to cover the width of the tire. Just poorly designed overall. I would not purchase these again.	1
My review basically says it all. I did not have a chip, I had a spider webbing crack, about 1 inch by 1 inch. This did nothing for it.	1
I've had a lot of luck with LED auto bulbs off Amazon, these were the exception. I put these in my Ford Ranger and only 1 out of the 4 worked. Had to return for a refund.	1
I put it on the first night and the bands ripped out of place. I had to rig it up to get it to stay in place. It bunched in the corners because there was too much material. But it does its job.	1
I did not see any difference even after applying for long time. It may work better on older paints (but I doubt it). Does not even remove swirls, I was very attentive and applied for long time - no difference at all. Does nothing.I Do not recommend this one.	1
This is a well made water regulator but it restricts the water flow to much so there is hardly any pressure in the camper.  Basically, a waste of money IMHO.  Get one with a pressure gauge and that allows you to regulate the actual water pressure.	1
The crampbuster does not work as advertised for me. I need to keep adjusting it upward. I tried a piece of 200 grit sandpaper and roughed up the inside of the crampbuster, it did not work any better and I think I wasted my money on this one.	1
Split the first time I used it and I have a 2-5/16 ball Save your money and find another manufacture for your ball covering needs.	1
I was really hoping that these would put out some good light, but I found them to provide less light than the originals.	1
It wouldn't work for me which could of been a defective scanner.  The price was good, but I was unable to reset the ECU to extinguish the check engine light.	1
Bought this for my Subaru forester, the check said it would fit it didn't, wont waste my time sending back poor purchase	1
Leaves a sticky finish on my sofa, and does not protect against mild dew. I used Meguiar car leather cleaner and conditional, this really cleans my sofa well and doesn't leave a oily surface. Meguiar reduce the mild dew problem significantly.	1
I put one of these in my RV's porch light to replace the standard bulb and it melted. I checked the socket with a millimeter and the socket turned out to be fine. Not sure if it was just a bad unit or what, but I threw the other one away as I have no desire to have a fire.	1
After 1.5 months in the sun it ROTTED out. Not made for outside awnings as advertized. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!	1
Way too expensive for a such low quality product i justgong to use my regular product thus dont order this	1
I could not stand the smell of this. I threw it out after having it in my car for 5 minutes	1
It just doesn't fit very well. Hard to disconnect and had a faulty connection.  Typical low quality stuff from you know where. Basically, you get what you paid for. I highly don't recommend this.  Terrible product.	1
The one I received broke on the first torque adjustment.  Went from base to 20 ft. lbs. and it made a grinding sound then locked up.  Got it to move backwards, tried again... no luck.  Immediately sent back as defective.	1
I bought this stuff and it didn't clean anything off my chrome rims.  Worthless crap.  wouldn't mind getting my money back for this red bottle of goop.	1
This kit is impossible to use and is not worth the money. Regular vinyl stick decals are easier to apply. The fact that this kit comes with wet sand paper indicates that it is difficult to use and may cause damage to the paint surface.	1
never got it to work,no help or support with software,so i sent it back to get my money back,they should not sell crap that dont work.	1
I have washed these towels several times and I cannot get them to stop shedding like a dog. They are wonderfully soft, thick and plush but they just keep shedding fibers like mad.	1
Well At least Ive never heard that before but I will say it about this product. The jack was unabable to lift my car high enough for the 2 ton jacks reccomended along with this product. So unless you have a dam even driveway get a jack that can lift a little bit higher.	1
Okay, I didn't expect a lot, but I did expect it to inflate an automobile tire. Compressor would come on, but tire would totally deflate while running--same thing with trying to inflate a bicycle tire! I learned my final lesson with Slime. This was not my first faulty product from this manufacturer.	1
The product I received was different from the photo on-line.  Even different from the photo on the product box.  I sent it back to be replaced, and I got the same, wrong product.  I'm sure I could have made it work, but I don't like buying one item, and getting shipped something else, twice.	1
I ordered  6 of these  and  it didnt last, used them onmy new dodge ram 1500  and  it was  disappointing  on new Goodyear tires,  i went with Duplicolor Tire spray and  it last  soooo much ,longer	1
Once winter hit and the road salt got on the blades they began causing a LOT of smearing. I would highly recommend Rain-X Latitude but not this.	1
I do not know how bright they are because they did not fit any light assembly on the car! Uhg!	1
I wanted to like this but all it did was squeak and bounce across the glass and the car surface, leaving the water behind. It was useless.	1
I followed the instructions TO THE LETTER, and my headlights look the same as they did before!  This product did not work at all for me!	1
This stuff dries way too fast...stay away unless you have a Buffer Machine - Unimpressed!  Get McGuiars its soo much better.	1
These work as a 3156 backup light but not a 3157.  My 96 F350 needs 3157 for running, turn, and break lights.  These don't work.  I plugged them into my backup light 3156 and they did work.	1
Ugly, heavy, uncomfortable and hot. There is really nothing good to say about this jacket. Save your money and order something else.	1
For those who wants to purchase thi 45 degree turn stop. It will leak when there is a rush of waste water coming out. The seal from the hose can not handle this type of pressure. The 90 degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal.	1
These Suck. I bought 2 of these for my car, and only one of them worked. The one that did work was blinding and made the vehicle look tacky.Would not recommend	1
This stuff didnt work at all. The intructions were a bit hard to understand, but once figured out, the product was a piece of garbage anyway. Didnt really make a difference, if anything made the problem worse.	1
Lamps did not fit as promised, should of returned them but too late now! Did not fit the socket for the lamp on any light of the car.	1
These are not HID like, they are not even ID without the HThey are not whiter, not brighter and not even better than stock.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THESEThe other ratings you read here must have been paid for .Move on and don't buy these .I just save you 30+ bucks.	1
Product worked great for three days. Then that was it. Seemed like a good product at first but definitely can't recommend.	1
NEEDS DRIVER AND SOFTWARE HELP WILL NOT INSTALL AUTO INSTALL DISC WONT DO NOTHING BUT TELL YOU WHAT IT WONT DO.	1
junk don't buy	1
Does not work as advertised. Followed the instructions, but was not able to get the headlight lens on my 2009 RV.	1
Leather tear and stitches coming out on both gloves in the inner-finger areas.Sending them back for refund. Would not recommend you purchasing them.	1
Piece of junk. Took forever to inflate a normal car tire and broke after about 2 months. Total waste of money.	1
I bought this product ( two cans )  a few weeks ago from another site and it is not what it claims to be.It left a white gummy residue on my tires and no shine. I eventually had to return one can.	1
First off, I could not see any benefit using this product in my toolbox. It's a 30-day product so what's the point? I suggest priming and painting any metal items to prevent rust.	1
Dont buy not worth it to epensive did  gave it a try but i had to remove it whith my regular body shine thank you	1
garbage product, i spraied it well until the can became empty, i have stuck brake dust just after 3 days of driving, so the commercial is???????.	1
Unfortunately I was feeling cheap when I decided to replace all my bulbs. Now everything flickers. I feel like there is a disco going on when they are in use..  just pay a little extra for some quality, your not going to be happy for very long with these.	1
Really disappointing! A waste of money for me!  I have a 28' 5'ver and all this damn thing did is put a lot of stress on my rv tire that it was on and never got the other tire off the ground.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Go back to the old reliable way with a Jack.	1
The product description shows the size as 15x15x4 inches which is likely to be the size of the cordset when it is coiled but it tells me nothing as to the length of the cord when it is uncoiled - important information and as the seller is Amazon there is no one to phone or email to request the information.	1
I bought the full set of these, and in triple quanities  due to TV  muscle car recommendations, No wonder local auto parts stores  dont carry this products, It stained my dash and speedometer  plastic, leaves  residue in windsheild over spray,.	1
This is a great idea, but the one I received had several pinhole leaks.  Not just seepage, but small jets of water from bad casting.	1
The bristles on the brush are basically strands of stiff plastic and I have not found it to do any cleaning at all around the lug nuts. Save your money.	1
i tried to wipe it off as in the instructions, and the surface was cool, it left large black circles on hood , didn't go away with regular washing, went away with waterless foamtek  only!!!!!	1
I did not like this product, other users I spoke to liked it. I found it difficult to clip together even when looking in a mirror. I would rate this as a no stars, do not buy.	1
Greesy, messy, doesn't spread evenly and attracts dirt. Using it to shine my tires until its gone because its worthless for anything else.	1
The rear of the meter is exposed and very sensitive to the elments. The Panel fell apart as I tried to install it. I do not understand why they do not install it into a plastic box even to be used in a panel a box would make it easier and less fragile to handle.	1
better understand now what you can do (repair) and what not... if you are trying to mend a tear or rip just simply forget it...	1
This item that I ordered twice in two different sizes. Always said it would fit my 2013 jeep wrangler sport unlimited. Never fits!! Says easy to install, but it does not go over the light cover. Really wanted this to work the second time. Chance the description and say doesn't fit 2013 jeeps.	1
THIS IS NOT YELLOW .IT IS CLEAR &#60; NO USE FOR EXCHANGING BRAKE FLUID IN SYSTEM.I wanted yellow or blue to see exchanged fluid .Not possible with this item.Beware you wil be unable to return this can through  Amazon.	1
This gauge is terrible.  It does not inflate well, the trigger pull is tiny, your hands will cramp up before something is inflated, even a soccer ball took minutes to inflate.  Trust me, view what other customers viewed after this item and try those. Pass on this, don't get suckered in by the low price.	1
In less than a year these brackets have rusted . The thing is I keep my Bike in the garage when not in use. Once again most likely made in China like must things SOLD at Amazon.	1
These wipers are noisy and leave streaks. I could tell they weren't well made right when I took them out of the package. You get what you pay for.	1
A could not imagine that factory manufactured item can be so much off. Sizing of the socket too loose even for 7/8" and completely unaceptable for 22 mm.As mentioned in other reviews oversized sockets will round the nut surface since the full force will be applied to a very small area of the edges.	1
I purchased these water filters to lessen the likelihood of water spots after washing my vehicles as suggested in several online forums. Unfortunately, we have very hard water here in the Northeast and it did not resolve the issue with spotting.	1
I have a 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe and these backup bulbs will not fit into the sockets. This was a total waste of time and I returned them for a refund.	1
This was a &#34;eh give it a shot&#34; purchase and I already regret the purchase. The tip of the wand is coming apart, and it really doesnt make the cleaning of a rim or wheel easier.	1
THIS IS ONLY FOR A DODGE!GOT ONE!SENT IT BACK!I HAVE AN AVALANCH!  There"re page does Not give you a choice,although they say its "custom " fit for every vehicle. I called  DeeZee manufacturing and they do Not sell these amazon so watch your choices :-)	1
This product has silicone which has been proven to degrade tires and dry them out. So while this product will make your tires look shiny, the tires will not last as long if you use this.The manufacturer claim that this product protects your tires is completely false.	1
Will not buy again. Tooo small of amount and marginal performance.	1
This thing will break within 5 minutes of your first use.  The plastic which holds the head on is incredible thin and unable to move without the wash head flying off.	1
Got this to keep my lawn mower maintained.  I keep it outside most the year, and was surprised to read that this product is NOT intended for outdoor use.  Called the company and they explained this product is designed to be used inside a vehicle.  Kind of defeats the purpose of this product.	1
As soon as I plugged it in I heard a "pop". No output. I guess try another inverter and probably another Cobra.	1
I don't understand why but the two brushes I got were terrible. I used them to wash the small crevasse's on my motorcycle. The problem was the fact that the brushes wouldn't go back to their straight position. As I would move them back and forth, the brushes would just follow. It reminded me of a severally bad tooth brush.	1
I thought this company was consistant with their product value. Not only did I get plastic hooks ( that I can bend with my fingertips).. instead of last year's metal hooks, I found out they lowered their price 3 bucks 2 weeks after I bought this just recently.Thanks for the lesson!	1
i wouldnt  buy again,  doesnt last, take the time and do a  good hand wax application,  might be handy  for  a quik dusting,  thatsd about it,  dont use on interior  as it eats away  the lettering  on handles/ etc	1
Bought this cause of the name... it does not smell good at all... I used it once and have not used it again.. maybe its just my preference but I did not like it.	1
It did not fit and I returned it. I ordered a FRAM and it fit right in. Plus FRAM had a rebate.	1
Since Griots makes you buy this separately I thought it would be a good product. Not so. This sprayer didn`t make it through half the bottle when the seals broke. The speed shine is a great product,but the sprayer is crap. Save your money and just pour the speed shine in an empty Windex bottle like I had to do.	1
this is not what i ordered or even close. does not look the same in color shape or size. buyer beware	1
Yeah, it says it but don't try to tint anything on your car or you will get pulled over, trust me.	1
This is no better than scotch tape.  I thought it was going to be a flexible fabric type product.  Instead it is like a plastic tape that doesn't stay stuck. I do not recommend this product.  It's a waste of money.	1
I returned this items because it contained lead in why in this day an age would something with lead in it still be sold ?	1
Did't work the plugs were off set and the fuses will not plug into them.  Thanks to Amazon for refunding me my purchase price because all they did was take up room in my garbage can.  DO NOT BUY THESE unless you plan on throwing your money away.	1
This is the worst piece of crap ever. I was always warned about buying the gimmicks on tv. It didn't do what it stated it would do, I did better cleaning my windows with window cleaner and a regular microfiber cloth. This was a waste of my money and time buying this piece of crap.	1
This thing didn't fit into my 2006 Honda Civic. It's supposed to, but the frame was not trimmed correctly. The build quality is poor.	1
What else can I say?  It is DOA.  Tried with GPS, tried with Phone, tried different cables and didn't work.	1
Wiper came loose and allow arm to scratch wind shield. I even check several times to made sure wipers are attached securely. Lousy design.	1
I haven't had this battery long, and I haven't used it that much, but it's already leaking (so much for "sealed").  Other than that, it does seem to handle charging and discharging well, though I question for how long, given the way its leaking.  I do like the terminals and the way they're color coded (red and black).	1
Used this on RV porch light, super bright and white, simple to use, great replacement to bulb. easy to change	2
This is third set of these fog lights, these seem better made than last set purchased on Amazon. The last set only lasted about 1.5 years. The problem I have had was water getting inside light housing and burning out bulbs. I hope these last longer than last set.	2
Much easier to handle than those slinky type hoses. More compact as well. Fit right in the rear bumper expect for the large orange piece that actually fits into the park system. Great buy as well here on Amazon.	2
Ah, the luxury of using your battery powered drill to lower and raise your RV jacks!  Sure, it is only five minutes or so, but it is so easy!  Plus set the torque on your drill for consistent jack lift every time.	2
Very powerful and easy to use.  Very expansive, you can check and reset just about every system.  Come with USB cable, so no need to buy separately.	2
A shovel is required for 4 x 4 beach use in my area. This shovel fits the bill perfectly. Most of the portable camping shovels have a small blade. The blade on this shovel is large.  The handle extends to a nice length. It's construction is high quality.	2
Come with mounting clips in place ready to push onto the origianl ball mounts. (make sure balls are not worn out also)Easy to change and lower cost than I've seen in the past, found nothing to gripe about and now hope they last a good long time.	2
It is a D Ring. It is in the shape of a &#34;D&#34;. I need a few more words to meet the minimum number of words for this review. Just kidding. It's high quality. The coating has only chipped a little from moderate use. I would buy it again. A must have.	2
At least when I bought it on Amazon. This is practically the same filter that is used from the factory or as a replacement part in I-6 BMW's. UOA confirmed it works as designed!	2
Was a little tight but worked good where needed.  In hot weather I remove the neck warmers on my half helment which also takes away the ability to put my blue tooth head phones in a pocket, this takes care of &#34;that&#34;.	2
Does what it's suppose to do ... nice addition with the added rubber coating makes it easy to handle ... and for the price it's a steal!	2
I use this on the rubber trim on my old Mercedes. I live in South Carolina, so the intense heat and constant sunlight (I don't have a garage) does a number on exterior trim pieces. This stuff makes them look and feel like new. It's amazing. I'll try to remember to upload some pictures later.	2
Bought this to use with the torque app on my android device. It works great.  This is a lot more convenient to use than a standard scanner and can provide a lot more info when paired with an application like Torque.	2
This hose works great for getting fuel from the tank to the engine on the equipment it is installed on. I would recommend this to even my neighbor, it is that great.	2
one of my fave car washes.  its really thick and foams up nicely.  cleans the car with out stripping off wax so car doesn't have the dull appearance like with some other washes or dish soap.	2
I use this polish after using M105 on the car.  This product does a great job of finishing up the looks and making the car shine even more.	2
Solid made pump, works very fast. Pump gets hot if run very long. Less than 2 minutes to inflate auto tire. well made. I will buy another, quiet for power.	2
This hose is the cat's meow. It is rugged, very flexible, and it compacts nicely. It comes with everything you need to hook up to any sewage pipe. LOVE IT. MUST GET.	2
Great item for the money.  You do not have to spend upwards of two hundred dollars to determine what is malfunctioning with your car.  This item can do it for less than 30 dollars.  It sure helps to know what you need exactly when I enter a repair shop.  Thanks for an inexpensive and valuable tool.	2
If the government could only work so well.  Blows like an angry Democrat!  Wish I could use this fan to blow the illegal aliens back home!!!!!	2
I have tried Zaino, Meguiars, Optimum, Various Chemical Guy's products and many others and this is the best beyond compare.  It's a little pricey but worthy every drop.  Make sure you use a high quality microfiber cloth and this will bring out the richness in your pain if it is pretty good shape.	2
These are fantastic. For this 7&#34; pad, you need a 5.5 inch Velcro backer or a trimmed 6 inch. I found out the hard way.	2
Very good product.  I order another because the old one will fall out soon enough.  Nice when things work out!	2
Installed on my '13 Wrangler. Make sure you look and do a test fit before removing the film off the 3M tape. They are a very specific fit.	2
First time trailer owner and was given great advice.  The difference is amazing.  I would not tow without this set!	2
I like this light bar hear are a couple reasons one it is consider a oem part and will bolt right on to you jk jeep plus for me I didn't want a light bar that was taller then my hood and I wanted a bar that behind the bumper so it work for me	2
Excellent results. Used to level our 38' motorhome. Definitely would purchase again. Their not cheap price wise but then they are well made and very sturdy.	2
Cleans all the dirt, smells great and keep your car shinnyi love Meguiar's products and for me this is the best shampoo for my car	2
Gets the job done.  I have used this on my camper and friends and it really blows the gunk out of the hot water heater	2
Installed it yesterday. Looks great! Much needed improvement for a low price. We will see how the paint holds up as per other users have complained	2
This wheel brush is great for cleaning wheels. Go figure! But seriously... I was previously using a sponge and this is worlds better.	2
You can run diags in your iphone see whats up with your car alot of features for the price you can reset the codes after you make the repair it decodes the problem code and you can fix yourself saves you hundreds in repair bills also avoids you from being ripped off from garages since you know what is worng	2
Very nice harness. High quality, exactly as you would expect from Battery Tender products. Would purchase again if needed. Recommended.	2
This thing looks good and does exactly what it says. It's heavy duty rubber and seems like it should hold up well. I've only had it for a month. I'll update this review if falls apart after some use.	2
I love these!  It didn't think they would be they good for room darkening, but they do a great job.  I also don't have to constantly keep replacing them at night because they don't fall out!	2
It really helps to keep the car safe from water and sun. It's easy to apply, feels oily, and the water goes away easily.	2
works great for jacks so u don't starch or slide off the frame or where ever u put it plus it matches all my prothane parts on my truck	2
using it as illumination for a trailer license plate.  super bright.  way brighter than the similar style incandescents that have always been the norm.  im thinking about getting one or two for lighting around our 12v off grid cabin.  they would be plenty bright to light up a set of 5 or so stairs.	2
I used this strap to get a little better pull angle with my snatch block. The pull was a very hard one and my Smittybilt winch busted into pieces. The mounts on the winch actually split and then ripped the entire winch apart. The strap along with my winch line and D-rings held well.	2
I really like these trims for my turn signals!  My jeep is Rock Lobster Red and trimmed in black, so these really made the front end pop!  Just clean your signal area really good as directed, remove the adhesive backing and insert and press, that is all there is to it!  Great look!	2
works great on tires,trim,bumpers and lights any plastic or rubber very slick and shiny,shiny,shiny stuff,your surveys are way to long.	2
This chock is much easier to install and especially easier to remove than normal chocks; holds the tires still which makes the trailer more steady. It also has a place where you can lock it so it won't &#34;walk&#34; away while you are away from your campsite.	2
I like these because they are thick, soft, have a long nap and short nap side, and are bigger than the Polishing Cloths.  I could remove the wax haze from the exterior of my full-size car with one towel without feeling I was driving the old wax into the new finish.	2
This tow ball is a great step up from the stock u-haul one i had. This adds +1500lb towing capacity and is a lot sturdier. Rock solid and nothing can get through this. Surprised at the price, should be more for how much of a tank it is. Great buy!	2
Performed a test out in a nearby parking lot with my camper. Once placed under the tire, the item never slipped when the camper was pulled up onto the item. They are wide enough not to be concerned about the tire slipping off the side of the item.	2
Pros:- Fit Decently in 922 Socket- Nice Cool LightCons:- NoneI used three of these to replace the cargo lights and third brake light in my F-350. They work great, and stay much cooler than the standard bulbs. These have about a 6000K color. They are slightly brighter than the stock bulbs.	2
No need for any kinda Velcro or tape to hold these ... they are stuffed and a tad bit over-sized for a standard vent and they fit snug in there PERFECTLY! I'm sure it helps a tiny bit holding in heat and also works to block out light coming from the clear vent top. Great buy.	2
I would recommend buying the extension....just in case.  Tough material.  Fits perfectly and have never had an issue.  When it comes to dumping.  No news is good news and I'm glad to say I've got no news to report.  I've used this from day one and will never use anything else.	2
Almost like using a leather belt on your knife blades, very handy to have around	2
Fits my 2013 F150 FX4 with a little wiggling, but otherwise pretty easy to mount (instructions could have been clearer), sturdy, and looks great.  Black powdercoating seems pretty good, but I can't speak for longevity as I've only had this for 2 months.	2
I've used these on several Honda products with good results. Of course one has no way to tell how well a cabin filter is working, so all I can judge by is visual quality and fit. On those measures, these are very nice.	2
Great thick cables to get the job done without fear of getting the cords too hot jump after jumps.  A great item to carry in any car or just to have around the house.	2
Bosch Clear advantage Beam  wiper Blade is an excellent product It excells in heavy wind and rain. I love it ! Also it is not noisey like my old blades.They are very easy to install. And  No annoying squeeks. I wish I had gotten them sooner !!	2
Finally got to use it on my and grandkids cars.  What a great tool, nice design, light and clamps easily on valve stems with no leaking.  Threw away my old useless pop-up stem indicator inflator.  This is the tool for my home garage...	2
This is an effective metal polish.  It seems to be pretty versatile, working well on jewelry and even chrome on your car.  No complaints.	2
Replaced  ten year old oem bulbs with these. Very nice white light. May not be actual white but compared to  the old it is brilliant white. So far very nice color and great improvement in ability to see. Hope they last long but the price is good compared to equal products in other brands.	2
Great item, fits perfect, good instructions, easy open, highly recommended, great price, fast ship, and will buy again. Looks great, too and cleans very well.	2
This was a great investment. If you don't have a &#34;window&#34; into the &#34;project&#34;, you will not know that you've completed cleaning up your &#34;business&#34;.	2
Bought it to flush my differentials out with, but I suppose it would work great to clean your brakes too ! ha.	2
These are rugged, very solid and made in the USA. These are also lightweight and will pack/travel easily. A snap to use, you'll find this product much easier to work with than other traditional leveling methods. I recommend going to their website to see a video demonstration.	2
The device clapped is tucked into the rim of my half helmet and you would think that it came stock that way. It certainly keeps my ears warm with my face mask while riding in 30 degree weather.	2
1. Made in the USA and supports American jobs. 2. Very high quality like someone really cared when they designed and built these stands. 3. What is your safety worth? - I would never risk my life by getting under a car with cheap import jack stands.  Worth every penny! Work safe, stay safe, enjoy life.	2
Great product, simple install, and gives a more rugged look to your wrangler and also adds needed protection from a free-swinging door. Install was a breeze and took only 5 minutes. Prep the surface with rubbing alcohol, peel the plastic of the sticky 3M auto tape, and press. Simple, yet looks awesome!	2
I need this 25 foot extension cord in the garage to reach about 15 feet from the battery tender to my riding mower. The tender is doing its job and the mower should be ready to go in the spring.	2
This is really a good meter to test for hot stuff. I have used it in my line of work to test for STDs and STIs. You just put one in in the mouth and the other in the yoohoo and if the screen shows 666 then you are in trouble!	2
I picked up a few of these d-rings to go with my atv's recovery equipment. Never had to use them other than practicing winching out but even then they work flawlessly.	2
Compact and nice to use.	2
OE for BMW fog lamps. No complaints. Inexpensive, name brand quality, easy to replace, bright, not much else to say	2
Best price I could find.  Timely delivery. Does the job for my 2008 ML320 CDI.  Change my own oil - a whole lot cheaper than the dealership.  And, most importantly, I know the right oil was used.  Very easy to change the oil with one of the inexpensive dipstick vacuum pumps.	2
My search for this went on forever at the local auto stores, even at retail stores and accessory shops, so I finally decided to buy it here. It fits the spare tight, and comes off easily, like a shoe, and it gives my Jeep a more appealing look. Good accessory purchase in all.	2
I put these on all my snowmobiles and motercycles to keep the tender on them in off season.  it works flawlessly.	2
I was using Turtle Wax &#34;black box&#34;, which is also great... but this single application product from meguiar's is really fantastic.  As with all liquid(ish) wax, let it dry... let it dry a long time.... and you're going to get great results.	2
Pretty simple...not much to say here. They fit right into the axillary track in the awning, and then you hang party lights etc from there.	2
This is very nice, we can plug into the cigarette lighter and have 4 ports for other electronics, just wish it had more than 1 USB port	2
Love the cigarette lighter attachment. Seems well built and works well. Price is much lower than other battery maintainers. So far so good	2
This product works wonders for my jeep wrangler plastics and love the fact it doesnt have ingredients that will later make the plastics brittle and fade.	2
I got the 9006 or the HB4 harness I like it  seems to be well made sturdy and will do a good job for what I need so my headlight wiring doesn't take on so much stress with the hid lights	2
I have 2 silver cars and after each wash I use this to remove streaks and protect the paint. Also, it gives an excellent shine and enhances gloss to the cars. I use it on the darker coloured wheels(rims) to enhance the look as well.	2
Griot products are dealer quality. I always wondered how dealers were able to impart that new car feel and smell to leather upholstery. Now I know. This is for any car enthusiast who wants the best quality leather care. I strongly recommend it.	2
Large wand is great allowing you to get in there and clean but also very soft not to scratch. Feels durable and after 50 washes still performs as new.	2
Good product!- drain/refill your coolant without putting a mess- easy to bleed air of the coolant system- easy to useWath video on youtube to drain/refill and bleed air out of your coolant system if you don't know how to use it. It's so easy with this funnel.	2
I really like having this organizer and having everything secure and at my finder tips.  My job requires me to be in a vehicle about 85% of my time and little things like this really help keep me organized.	2
I have used the Stealth Wiper Blades a few times now and continue to be amazed at how good they are and their long life (I always wipe of the blade when I get gas to keep it clean). What sells me on them is the aerodynamics of the blade over the competition.	2
the  amazon brand  if  half the price  of  the  &#34;big guys&#34; .. works  awesome  .. I have  a jeep  that  never  has  a top on it ..  on those cold  days  these  things  make  a BIG  difference	2
Nice price for a bag that is big enough to be used as it is intended. So many manufacturers make a bag that is so small you can't use for its intended purpose. nice looking too.	2
KC mounting brackets are great!! Heavy  duty well worth the money . One down fall is that back has no form of padding it is metal on metal but for the quality I can deal with that !!!!	2
Great product. Am able to charge all of my toys along with using the USB Port. I have affixed it to the side and works very well.	2
I was unable to install these so I had my local Chrysler dealership install them. I noticed that each front one is cracked, but too late to claim it. I had easier installs with WeatherTech	2
This item works just as described! I like it for the uses it offers and I'm grateful I bought it.	2
Works flawlessly in every vehicles and ive tried it on big commercial trucks suvs and your every day work horse its a good deal and works like the other more expensive brands	2
Easy install.  This should be stock on all Rams.  Makes 100% easier when your hands are full.  Tailgate lowers slowly.	2
I was looking for a carrier to put on the back of my travel trailer.  something to put my generator and cooler on.  this met my dimensions and assembly was simple.  11 nuts and bolts and less than 10 minutes and its ready to go	2
Have not tried until we go camping.  I think it will be better than the original equipment.  Will update later.	2
Easy to use and keeps dirt off when it rains and sunshine off the tires! Looks good while protecting the tires!	2
Use it for a scissor jack, light use for turning bolts with a drill (not for impact use). It frees up a socket and adapter for other things and I can leave this with the trailer.Works pretty well with a battery operated drill and saves hand cranking.	2
These are lightweight and install easily.  They cover the wheels completely for sun protection to help preserve the rubber tires.  They fold up small so easy to carry in the RV too.	2
These things are bright. I bought three of em and they light up the night in my truck cab. The sticky side doesn't work on all materials but thats an easy fix	2
I installed it on my 2009 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. Very easy to install. Just take the tape off. Make sure you have it aligned well before you take off the tape first.	2
These microfiber towels are nice and plush.  I use them solely on my paint for compounds/polish and sealant/waxes.  Easy to wash too.	2
its great! my bike runs better then i thought it would. more smooth then ever before. i will buy again!	2

I bought two of these for my crazy lab and sheepdog and they have worked perfectly over the past two years. Feels solid and sturdy unlike some of those cheapo ones out there that fail or fall apart.

I use this for baking and the bag size combined with price and quickness of delivery is perfect.  If you want to bake yourself a sweet but feel guilt free, this is the way to go.

I've alwaays had the cassia cinnamon, both for cooking and as a supplement.  This is quite different....subtler (is that a word?)Most of it gets filled into little capsules but I've used a bit in cooking and it really adds something to a 5-spice  :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Installed these on my outer sheds to light up so I can see and unlock the doors at night.  Works great for this.  As an added bonus, provides a measure of security since they come on if someone walks up to or by that area.  Provides a pretty bright cone of light around the area.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I don't know how I did without these before. They're easy to hold, sharp and precise. They make cleaning up threads very easy.

These are individually wrapped milk chocolates, each swirled with some caramel flavor. They're very good. The chocolate flavor definitely predominates, but you can taste the caramel as well. They're very rich and have a satisfying mouth feel. Each piece is a good size for a little treat.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I use these in areas where my cats pee inappropriately.  I have a plastic runner in those areas and place an OUT! training pad on it.

Short on flavor and not as advertised. Says no sugar but doesn't admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. My teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. I did not like it at all. Is it better than drinking pop? Probably but does the high price warrant the small differences?	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

These cookies were bought for my kids who absolutely loved them.  They were creamy and delicious, especially with milk. My kids ate them so fast that I had to go to the store within a couple days to see if they were being sold in the stores.  Luckily they were and I was able to purchase another box!

We had this slow close toilet seat for about a 1.5 yrs now and so far so good. No issues so far ...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Finally.A scooper that is sturdy enough to last.The plastic alternatives have always broken after a time.This one makes the plastic scoopers obsolete.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are great for training puppies! They are small and smelly... everything a puppy could love. I like that Zuke's uses nutritionally sound ingredients and for a decent price, as you have to use A LOT of treats when you train a puppy. I highly recommend these for both pups and adult dogs. I will continue buying.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This stuff is by far the most potent catnip I've found anywhere. My kitty loves it! This is the 2nd time I've ordered the bag of catnip and I haven't been disappointed. You actually get quite a lot too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Yummy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i got a bread flour, whole wheat bread flour, cornmeal, and pastry flour. i have already used some of these flours with the exception of the pastry flour. i guess i need to find some recipes to use it in. other than that i will purchase again, if/when i need to.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are really excellent chips. They sounded good but I wasn't sure how much I would actually like them. Turns out, they are fantastic. A little bit of spice, a little sweetness. Opened them at a cookout and everyone loved them. Highly recommended!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Completely adjustable, fits true to size. Clasp meets right at the shoulder blades. My dog is allergic to any non-synthetic fabric. Fully nylon harnesses are important.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've been drinking the double spice chai tea now for over a year.  I've tried a lot of other brands but find this one to have the strongest flavor (without having to spend too much, or making it myself).  So if you like your chai a bit spicier then this one is for you!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I run with my pitt/retriever mix - about 65 lbs of dog. This leash let's me run hands free, and the times when he lunges after a bird or squirrel, he doesn't throw me off balance (well a little bit). Also adjusts so I can use it as a normal leash.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My dogs love these and now look forward to their medicine. No more hassles and they are a better value in the six packs.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Product arrived on time and in good condition.  The blade was just as shown in the description and has performed as would be expected.  Litlle to no sanding is needed when using this blade.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have several indoor cats and I'm always looking for things for them to do.  These are a great little fill in toy.  I've found it's best to only put down one at a time.  You'd think everyone would enjoy having their own toy; but, they seem to enjoy &#34;stealing&#34; it from each other more.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this to do some light pre-paint sanding and prepping. Have used it on automotive parts so far and it has been great. The case was a must for me so the tool doesn't slosh around in my tool cabinet, and it is very good quality. Amazon always has great prices on power tools.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this charger, so much so that I bought a second one.  It shuts off when the battery is charged.  It won't cook your expensive batteries.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My dog loves the taste and does not mind having his teeth brushed when I use this toothpaste. I brush every day and he has lovely white teeth.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Great peanut butter, great taste.  holds well without being refrigerated. Nice size bottle too.  I'll be buying again from here.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought these to pull the hair out of my Havanese puppy's ears.  Being a silky long haired dog the hair grows in her ears.  To keep her ears healthy it needs to be pulled out about once a month but it is very hard to do with fingers.  This mini-stat works great !	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this as a wish list donation for an animal rescue group. These are highly absorbent puppy wee wee pads. underlay is plastic for no mess leaking! affordable and durable	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My brother has a kitten that's all over his countertops. He uses several of these as a deterrent. Does the job... Only problem is kitty still goes up when they are not down. Hoping this gets better with time and age.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 65lb pit bull terrier loves this toy; he's a plastic bottle addict and the combination of crinkles + plush is just irresistible. A longer velcro strip would make it a bit harder for a wicked smart dog to get the toy open. Will fix that after Xmas.This toy is definitely 2 dewclaws up!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought these when I started my diet. They are very good and the nutrition statistics make them an acceptable snack food for those dieting.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I purchased this to create an extension cord for the Lincoln 170 mig welder I have.  It was a great price compared to my local true value hardware.  It works well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My Boston Terrier has been using it for four years and hasn't had to have any dental work--all the Bostons we've owned over the years have had to have work done early and often.The cats have also benefitted from it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Probably the best portable drill I have. Very handy for a portable one. Many features and the one I did not expect is a front light that helps a lot on dark places.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

i have bought lots of tennis ball for my GSD, and they were all chewed up in an hour.  these ones are worth spending little extra.  i have them for almost a month and they are still in good condition (not chewed up).	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These jams are absolutely wonderful--full of fruit and so delicious on toast and PBJ sandwiches. Amazon's price under Subscribe and Save is much less than what I would pay at my local grocer--you can't lose!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This playpen was exactly what I wanted - simple to set up, sturdy enough to keep my dog from tipping it over and spacious enough for my dog.  I have a toy sized dog and it gives him lots of room.  Great item to have on hand and at a great price.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Good product to test your aquarium water.  Bought this at Amazon, it's a lot cheaper than at Petco or Petsmart for similar products.  It comes with a lot tubes and you feel like a chemist at work, testing pH and all the other parameters.  My kids love it too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have multiple dogs.  All sizes, all ages, and multiple breeds.  They all love these.  In fact, they go &#34;crazy&#34; for them.  Not sure what is in them, but they small good, and look good.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This item has reignited our dogs' fascination in the water bowl.  The item was easy to put together and worked flawlessly out of the box.  The best part is the easiness of cleaning by just putting it right in the dishwasher.  The size is perfect for all 6 of our dox.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are a great treat invention. The toys occupy the mind and last a good amount of time, though we did have our Australian shepherd on the orange ball it was a bit to soft for her chewing so we upgraded to the large blue one and it's perfect for aggressive chewers.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These glasses fit over regular glasses which is really a big plus for use glass wearers. The price was right and the service was fast.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I go through a lot of creamers at the coffee station at my office.  I like the fact that the International Delight French Vanilla Creamers don't need refrigeration and I like the convenience of Amazon  fulfillment.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Campbell's quality on the cheap-can't beat it.  Shipped fast with no damage to the cans.  Will buy again.  Can never have too much soup on hand!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This is really good popcorn.  I like the cheese flavor, it doesn't overpower the flavor of the popcorn.  It's a nice blend.  Just wish there had been more.  I need to check on the availability of it in my local stores.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Don't waste your money. It worked for a couple of months, kind of. The light was always blue even with really hot water, unless I turned the water off, then back on. Then the seal failed and now it's trash.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Title says it all.  They reformulated to add artificial sweeteners to their regular hot cocoa.  I didn't notice until I tasted it and thought I accidentally bought the diet stuff.  Nope -- they put splenda and asculfame K (asculfame potassium) into their formula now.  It's really gross -- much too sweet with a terrible aftertaste.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I needed this sheath!  Although meant for a Leatherman tool, It carries my Victorinox multitool quite nicley, along with a mini Maglite.  Very handy and durable.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I have had this for 6 months now. I use it with a vera. Battery still indicates 80%. I have also set it to use the key of my old lock (that i replaced).

There are two big holes in the top of the tube. It is wide and crinkles which the cats love. I can dangle rod & string toys into the holes to tease them and there are ties on one end to add a second tube which I did. It gets a lot of use.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

These replacement parts are a must so there is not much to say othe that installing it is simple since it only takes like 20 minutes.I dont know why this part after a few months or a year or so you need to replace it.

this is great stuff.  when it comes on the market i will buy it.  the pomegranate flavoring is surpurb.  funny thing it doesn't leave a after taste like regular licorice does.  the taste is smooth and enjoyable.  it does not harden up even after being left open for a week like regular licorice does.

This is my new go-to flavor. The vanilla taste isn't super strong like a nasty creamer. It's nice and light so you don't get sick of it by the end of a big mug. Only need half and half and the tiniest bit of sugar and it's perfection.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Some treats are so good you can really hurt yourself.  These really test my willpower.  It's one of those perfect tastes to me.  It's creamy with just the right amount of peppermint to top it off.
