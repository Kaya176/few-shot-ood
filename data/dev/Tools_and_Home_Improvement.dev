Cheaply made, and not very durable. This might work in a kitchen drawer for use in a pinch, but for daily work, NO WAY. Not to mention it is way too bulky to carry around in your pocket. There are better quality pen lights out there.	1
This is six bucks at Home Depot. Why would we pay $30 plus $11 shipping?Get real.	1
The specification section lists this as 500W max. When they arrived, the box said it was 300W max. Unfortunately, I bought 12 of them. It's amazing that Amazon still have not corrected this on their site! Wow.	1
I put this bulb into a fixture, turned on the light switch, and immediately heard a loud whining sound coming from the bulb. I'm taking it back and won't buy again.This is on a high-quality dimmer that works with Philips LED bulbs just fine.	1
IT'S JUST A SCREEN MOVING AROUND - I SENT IT BACK - MY OWN FAULT FOR NOT READING MORE CAREFULLY - BUT I DO LOOOVE THE JELLYFISH - READ MY REVIEW	1
Sprung a leak after the second day. I was cautious as i knew it was made of material, but got a hole it it after one use. Had to return for refund. Not sure if other brands are better, so i just went with an old fashioned hard hose instead.	1
It was great for about a month and then it would not turn off and since it is battery operated it died.  So I replaced the batteries hoping it was just a low battery problem but no the sensor is not working (I guess) because it just stays on unless turned off.	1
Brought this thermostat for a 2gig alarm system, arrived DOA.  Also be aware that this unit requires power to be supplied from your AC system 24v AC and does not have a battery option.  Ended up buying the 2gig CT100	1
this thing is obviously made in china with a ge stamp on it. 24 hour rotation is more like 11 hours 45 minutes. just plain junk.	1
These are quite bright... but not weatherproof.  Mine went dead within 6 months, filled with water.  If there were a weatherproof version of these that did not take on water, I'd buy again.	1
Shame on anybody who buys this garbage.  He is the president of our country.  For you to show such terrible disrespect indicates that you dont have any self respect.	1
the instructions show one thing, the screens mentioned do not existcannot be programmed by mere humansavoid at all costs	1
It is sad to see what DeWalt has become. They are now comparable to Ryobi / Harbor Freight products. This thing bit the dust after four hours of use. Profits before quality. . . I'm done with DeWalt power tools.	1
Crappy made. Had to bend it and do some hammering to get it together. Wouldn't buy another. I'd invest more money next time. You get what you pay for and won't do that again.	1
I was not happy with this at all.  Not a good BR30 replacement.  I think someone can come up with something better.	1
I'm not sure if these were produced square, damaged in shipping, or just never fit the bill.  I find them to be far from what's advertised as a &#34;machinist square&#34;	1
does not work too good, needs a huge box, which I had, but even after adjusting it for an hour, the front plate would not sit well, resulting in the clips not working on the doors, had to return it	1
tried it for water coming from deep wells ... results are too far off from the standard ... like by 500ppm.and calibration does not help	1
Buyer needs to be aware that this platform will not work on two piece extension ladder. The ad's ladders described as model M do not explain they are one piece multishape ladders. Ad does say it is for stepladders, however, which in most cases have their own platform.I would have appreciated an advisory of this platform's limitations.	1
I got 12 of the lights I just got them hook up two weeks ago and did a real good job to, here I am looking at the lights at night one goies out next night two more go out so now I am down to six light left, yep they suck they suck don't buy don't do it	1
The battery compartment needs redesigning.  Batteries won't stay in place, causing the LEDs not to come on untill readjustments are made with the battery cover.  And again, the lights can go out unexpectedly, requiring another batteries realignment.  It does not find the center of the stud as claimed.	1
This light claims to have a 30W bulb, however I would compare this light to a 10W LED Bulb and I know LEDs, don't buy this Flood Light.	1
Bought This And Tried The Sound Ohm And It Didnt Work So Then I Tried To Test A 12V Battery And Nothing Changed. It Was Junk Out Of Box.	1
This light would not work at all. I tried several pairs of batteries that I had already tried in a similar light and still this would not work. Returned it right away.	1
ordered this to pull some minor 'dings' on flat surfaces of my truck.  FORGET IT almost not enough suction to hold itself to the surface let alone do anything else. Save your money and get something else!!	1
Now I have to figure out how to get a refund from the manufacturer  since it's beyond amazon return, but I may try calling them.  This bulb started to blink after being outside in -6 degree F.  It's rated for -13.  Rather stark white too.	1
Doors will not close with these. Bought a four pack of soft closers at major hardware store and they all worked.	1
poor design, broke the first time I used it, the teeth stripped trying to loosen to remove drill bit.  All three locations for inserting the drill key stripped at the teeth.  I use all kinds of tools regularly and this is not a quality tool.	1
Just got my bulbs half of them do not dim and the other half flicker when you dim them. Poor quality I had high hopes based on the reviews I read	1
This is NOT a 2 Prog plug, it's 3 PRONG, 2 with Ground, BAD PICTURE.The plug is 2 prong 2 3 prong and has special scrws in the case so you can't take it apart and remove the ground plug.	1
This item is for some odd size flashlight. I have 15 and it was not even close to any of them. I was robbed.	1
when i got it it worked fine but like the other review it got dimmer. now it bearly works. dont bother with this light	1
This mini-snake was completely useless and landed in the trash very quickly.  I called the plumber who opened my drain in about 10 minutes with a real snake.  Don't bother with this one.	1
While the tech is secure there was not a lot of thought put into the physical security. The lock core is surrounded by pot metal.  A light hit with even a small hammer will crush the casing allowing you to compromise the lock.	1
This bulb doesn't work for me : it turned on at night, sometimes, then turns off a few minutes or hours later (at 1am...) then on again, at 3am... Sometimes, it would not turn on at all at night, or be on in the middle of a sunny day. It seems that quality control is lacking...	1
This light give an excellent light and has a great beam.  I have one in my car and one in my truck.	1
Just way to maliable to hold anything firmly. Metal bends with even slightest. Pressure making firm grip near impossible with these tweezers.  Get the stainless steel for better grip. The right angle tweezers used for gemstone. Is the best.	1
The flashlight broke off when I adjusted the light angle, just broke off!  So now I have a useless light, tripod is obviously cheaply made plastic or it wouldn't have broke.	1
Used in outdoor low voltage lighting system.  Dead after 5 month's.  All the other LEDs doing fine, but this was the only MR16 bulb.	1
The flashlight is fine, but the clip is useless. I'm not sure why I even bought this. What a waste of resources to even mail this piece of crap. Recycle bin.	1
This is one of the worst toilet flappers I have ever purchased.  I had to replace it in less than a month because it started leaking.  Replaced it with a Fluidmaster Universal Long Life toilet flapper, which I have used for years on my Toto toilets with great results.	1
Both batteries lasted about two charges then turned red hot, shorted out and melted the charging unit. Save yourself some money. If you have an old laptop battery, crack it open and use these 3.7 volts. If you buy some batteries, look out for the flood of counterfeits.	1
Not sure if I bought the wrong connectors.  I just ended up crimping the connector with pliers.  What a waste!	1
This products is tiny,flimsy and not worth what i paid.  This thing broke straight from the get go.  Do not buy this	1
It didn't work and we didn't realize it until it was hung very high on the garage. It is too hard to get to, so we are leaving it there. Useless...	1
After sawing a single piece of plywood it needs to be recharged which takes over night. That effectively makes it useless.	1
The ignition button lasted 2 uses, then quit. Tried using it lighting with a match which worked, but the off switch would not shut the flow of fuel off completely. Not worth returning as this torch is dangerous. Let the fuel run out by itself and threw it way.I've had good luck with Amazon, but not this time.	1
I am not a techno dummy.  I bought this unit thinking it will work with my Genie intellicode as well as a Liftmaster gate opener.  However, I can't even get it to work with my Genie unit yet.  I will give it another try later when I have more time.	1
Tried many times to use this stuff , I see no real use of this.Always looking for better way of doing things ,this is not it.As Always (ME)will give fair chance to work  ME NO HELP	1
I originally purchased this item on 6/1/11, on 6/7/11 I had to have a replacement because the hose started leaking, and spraying water everywhere. Yesterday 10/31/2011 I noticed that this "replacement" hose is now squirting all over the walls! I was surprised to see such high reviews, and such a poorly made product.....Keep looking	1
This tool is so weak and poorly constructed that I can't even classify it as "homeowner grade" much less professional grade. It is cheaply made and did not even make it through the first job before the little drive belt shredded itself.The adjustable table is a joke as is the stamped sheet steel platen. Returning it forthwith.	1
It doesn't even really look like a candle on or off.The light is so weak, even at the high setting that it only penetrates (and barely) the top of the glitter.The light is so weak, that it is hard to tell that it is "flickering".No batteries were included.There are so many better choices out there.	1
Air leaks around factory swivel ends.Do not buy!Took me a while to find 1/2" couplers, hence my time is up to return.So I emailed Holy over a week ago w/ no results. So it may look good that the seller responds to this web site but its another thing to actually walk the talk.	1
Non functional right out of the box. No light whatsoever after hooking it up and replacing a previous light fixture. Poor quality control.	1
I bought this at a local store to identify circuits in my 2 year-old home. One time it will work as expected, the next time it won't work at all, will identify the wrong circuit breaker, or will identify multiple circuit breakers.	1
attempted to use this and couldn't really figure out how to set it correctly - broke of the bolt I was attempting to not over tightenSo IMHO this sucked - thanks Amazon for accepting return	1
This item as well as another that promises similar performance has been nothing but a time consuming, battery expense burning, piece of aggravating garbage. This technology is 30+ years old- there is no reason for the endeavor of motion detection becoming such an arduous headache	1
Just not steady enough.  Does not give you confidence that the hand shower will not fall down.  Suction even on smooth surfaces is poor, easy to pull off.  Forget it on any porus surface.	1
Prob. ordered wrong have no use for it since it won't work no override. cost more time and money to send back than its worth.	1
These lamps are JUNK.  They are made in China and are pure garbage.  I only bought mine to dump the contents and replace the wax and fluid.  After that its the BEST thing going. Looks great.  Lava World has stopped making them because of the bad quality and constant replacement requests.	1
The fact they would claim a "list price" on this thing of $128 is DESPICABLE and DISHONEST. This is maybe a $10 product and I doubt that. I've seen it on other websites for less than $5 + shipping, I don't even think it's worth that though. SKIP IT, especially from anyone claiming this is a $100+ tool.	1
&#34;Type of Bulb Low Pressure Mercury Discharge&#34;This is obviously not true. How many other things they are saying are also untrue?  We have to read carefully. Caveat Emptor.	1
Very chip made garbage save your money and go for  a delta or other name bread the hose is so stiff  not very flexible for the money that I paid I could have gotten a better one.  you better off going for  name bread.	1
Good idea but mine quit working after three days.  Regret not saving the package so I could return it.  Others may have better experience but this was just a waste of money.	1
These are junky. The metal broke off on a bolt I was trying to loosen up as in fracture it across the entire lug area. If you plan on using them with your hands and not a drill,then get them, but if you put them into any power tools, think again.	1
This doesnt work as i though it would. I wanted it for U.K. plugs to use here in the USA. My laptop was bought in London so the charger is a standard U.K. plug this adapter did not work. waste of money!!	1
I did not buy this unit, but I did buy and return the similar Honeywell PLS750C1000, these claim to be three way switches, but require four wires.  Just a note if you plan to replace this yourself check your wiring first.	1
I had purchased on of these from a local store I liked it for my small dog that often runs my fenced yard at night.I ordered another light for my other dog.This one arrived with dead batteries.Returned to Amazon for a replacement.I love the light. I hate the poor quality.Apparently the dead battery problem is not a rare complaint.	1
I used teflon tape but it leaks where it attaches to the water supply pipe. Probably due to the fact that it swings around instead of staying in one position when the handheld is in the holder.  Another time suck returning this and shopping for another!	1
The second time I used the 7/16th one ,the side wall cracked and fell off. I would not recommendthis product.	1
Takes forever to heat up (Stahl Iron).  Iron seems a good deal for $15 but I have the dial up 80% just to melt lead/tin solder.  I'm guessing just at 25 watts or below.  I tried switching tips with one of these but same problem.	1
Our family loves flashlights of various types and we have a good idea of what 300 lumens looks like.  This can't be more than 25 lumens.  It's a fun toy for the kids, but it is not as advertised.  Not even close.	1
I loved the idea of this dimmer, and based on favorable reviews bought it for a sign install.  However the customer indicated that the device failed, and "splattered". I attribute it to the green plastic connector that plugs into the base.Customer removed it.	1
The 2 little screws don't hold the bits securely. It slips when drilling even wood. Don't recommend it. Look for something else.	1
I should have believed the other one star comments.  I took a chance and was proven wrong.The instructions are poor.  Difficult to program.  Best yet, does not turn on after programmed to do so......Junk?	1
Too bad. This should not happen but it happens. I dismantle it but so tiny electronic, impossible to see the problem.	1
Notice the picture at the top is NOT the same as the pictures in the product description. That is because they are not the same. The actual item delivered and in the top picture does not rotate up and down only side to side.	1
These are not worth the cheap &#34;steel&#34; that they are made from. I think they would bend hitting wood. I will stick with Harbor Freight cheap next time.	1
I bought this based on a recommendation from Amazon, and it is a bad recommendation.  Its poor quality, fell apart as I took it out of the package, one part was de-threaded so broken on arrival.  Non-standard bulb, avoid.	1
I should have listened to the reviews. I should not have gotten this saw. Save your money, that is my advice.	1
Don't buy this.  My unit does not detect motion and stays on all night long when it feels like it!!!!  Garbage like everything else made in China.	1
very very bad broke after first use was sent 2 more and both broke as well no go dont buy	1
My digital woodworkers gauge and lathe calipers by iGaging have both failed after limited use. The company has been unresponsive to request for any replacement parts, like battery holders.Something at a better price point may be more useful. Meanwhile, for me, a return to old fashioned dial indicators seems best. No funky batteries, better durability, better visual utility.JB	1
Almost imperceptible flickering, but I can see it if I am looking for it, and it makes my eyes hurt after a while. Apparently if you get a &#34;dimmable&#34; LED light that means flickering.	1
I purchased 8 of these and half of them did not work. Very cheaply made. The ones that did work were very dim. I would not buy these again!	1
Worked great for a few days then died. Nothing visibly wrong with it. Just stopped working. Not too surprised for a 24$ fan. If your fan happens to work then it's a great deal. But I would not use this fan where reliability is critical.	1
My unit suddenly stopped working at 8 months after the bulb burned out. Wrote an electronic letter to the company on their web site. Did not receive any response. Poor quality item and non existent customer service. Now thats a combo!	1
Do yourself a favor and youtube Kwikset smartkey. Lock is easily brute forced open without signs of damage and Original key will still open the lock.  Also it looks like it is now able to be attacked using a tailpiece attack.  Check it out for yourself. [...]I hope this helps you out.	1
the function where it should change the light setting does not work. It feels really loose, like you don't have that feeling if you are grabbing it on a maglight!	1
These worked the first night.  Second night they were dead.  Other than the fact that they don't work, they seem to be well-built and all...	1
Sent it back.  The holes out of which the cords must exit the box are too small.  The whole thing is just wriggly, flimsy plastic.  Doesn't accommodate anything but small wires and plugs.	1
Less than six feet, line of sight, to my router and it tells me signal strength is weak.Remote access would not configure. Said try later. Was able to turn on a test lamp once -- then never again. Firmware update wouldn't install. Returning to Amazon. Worthless. How on earth can Belkin sell something like this? Beats me.	1
As you can read, this product has a lot of issues.I live in a 100+ year old house without wi-fi.So this doesn't work at all. I can't really review it.	1
BEWARE. Broke after transferring only 30 gallons of fuel. Motor stopped working. Had fuel in battery compartment. This product should NOT be sold for flamable liquids. Save your money. It is garbage.	1
Some wrenches were miss-sized. Some bent. All were covered with a heavy dose of machine oil. Returning to Amazon next day.	1
Not robust enough for plasma cutting.  Burned right through on the slag.I returned it no problem.  Some more words for review.	1
The supplied hardware makes installation very difficult.  The screws are extremely long for this small device.  Then the battery never charges, or the switch never unlocks, or the motion is never sensed.  For sure, my unit never works with weeks or sunny days.	1
Item is cheaply made and has a very small area that it lights.  The remote is almost worthless.  I would not recommend this product	1
This piece of junk wouldn`t shut off if you launched it into the middle of the sun. I am now turning the switch on and off by hand. At least I can get some use out of it. The 14W is of some help.	1
Got this to find some pet stains.. I was very disappointed in how bright this thing is... Unless you're 3 inches from the carpet, it seems worthless!	1
if you got a tight spot and need a little more torqe, this is the tool for you i bought a hex socket set with this and they work well together i reccomend this tool	2
Works just fine, not the highest quality power strip I have used, but get's the job done.  It's actually a bit harder nowadays to find a basic power strip that has the low profile end.  This one fit the bill.	2
This right angle attachment holds the bits securely and turns quite smoothly, unlike another brand.  With a short bit, it can get into a small space.	2
I like this a lot, I bought it to adjust my saw blades but also use it on weird angles for building projects.  My only complaint is the use of a button battery, I'd really like it if they designed this to use a cr123.	2
I purchase this type of cord for my business. This medium duty cord is very durable and works great for extending power for my daughters television.	2
The extinguisher arrived much sooner than predicted. Saw trace amounts of what I believe to be the extinguishing powder just on the bottom of the extinguisher. I assume this is a byproduct of the manufacturing environment. The pressure-test indicator reads OK.	2
I bought these directly through Intermatic to be able to add another on/off cycle for my pool timer. They work perfectly and are heavy duty metal. Not easily bent or mishapen. Simply use the thumb screw to put them onto the time wheel and you are set. Great value with Prime shipping - check around on Amazon for multiple listings.	2
Good light. I like the two different modes. Works good I need to see how long the battery last. Fairly compact. I like the difference angles.	2
This product is absolutely pristine, and beautiful.  I haven't installed it yet, but have examined it closely in the box.  This would be a fine addition to any home.	2
This just what was needed for the kids to see what they have been missing.Outside they have it all to see from bugs to flowers.This is just great for the kids.	2
Good heavy duty extension cord. Same size wire as  your house wiring so no voltage loss. When you need something like this&#8230;you REALLY need it!  Would be great for wiring a portable  Generator to the house.  I'm glad I bought it.	2
Great little keyring. I use it primarily for the bottle opener, but I have used the prybar and screwdriver tool on several occasions when I was in a pinch.Seems very solid and durable, and I'm sure it will last for years to come.	2
This sucker rocks. I can see so far at night using it, not to mention it fits in my pocket.Excellent for photographers wanting to paint some light on trees at night while doing star shots.  I highly recommend it.	2
Fast shipping, good quality, very functional, compact for tight spaces, large choice of gauge sizes.  I would buy them again.	2
It's installed and seems to be working fine.  I don't know that much about water heaters so I guess it's performing as promised.	2
Out of the box, this thing cuts  nicely. If you know how to sharpen and tune a saw, this will cut fine joinery at a reasonable price. I am not a fan of turned handles, but this one feels OK. Highly recommended for budget minded dovetailers.	2
I use this one for driver bits and counter sinks to keep them organized  .I like the L box system ,would like them to bring out ones with different size drawers like festool has .	2
This little mixer is great if you are doing painting around your house that is being done in increments and you expect to use at least a gallon of paint although not in one day.  Clean pouring only what you need, airthight, no mess mixing.  If you're rolling it on by the gallons, not so much.	2
This product is easy to use and works excellent. Of course all of Kregs products are awesome and I highly recommed this tool as it makes task very simple.	2
I have bought several and given them as gifts. They are well made and very useful and handy to have around.	2
This is a great rough-in. The installation was a peice of cake. The spacing is perfect for a normal 2x4 wall with a 2x4 on the back to screw it into.I love Delta's lifetime warranty and the ability to change out the trim.	2
I mounted this light in a wall hanging jeweling box. It provides the perfect amount of light for this application.	2
Cutting in boxes in cabinets, siding or soffits has never been easier. I love this tool, I got a great deal of the day price for it too. What's better than that?	2
These earmuffs are very comfortable and they work wonderfully. I use them in my woodshop, when mowing the lawn, and when shooting. They pads seal well over eyewear. They are so comfortable I sometimes forget I have them on.	2
Love them!!!! Love my Sharpmaker. Sharpening made easy. There are more precise systems out there but I like this one so much. It makes it quick and simple. And by using these Ultra Fine rods you can get a very sharp blade.	2
Used it to cut 4x8 sheet of sandeply plywood lengthwise to make tops of 2x8 storage shelves. Cut was very clean. Very satisfied!	2
I purchased this light to use by my desk where I make and create my jewelry pieces.  It is just what I needed for that purpose.	2
Had a little single cabinet counter with a dual outlet receptacle above it. The area always had two or three chargers at it with a mess of cables for the wife's devices. This really cleaned up the space & works wellOnly wish the high output & low output were labeled on the face. Label maker took care of that.	2
What can I tell you, It's cheap but built like a Tank, it's as bright as some lights costing 100+ bucks. With a smooth finish and small form factor. I should have just ordered five for home and auto and been done with it.	2
Dewalt Hammer Drill DCD950B - I got this hammer drill to use around the house to mount some anchors around the Brick.  Won't put it to any really heavy use, just 1/4 to 1/2 inch holds in brick and concrete and mortor.  Works as I had expected.	2
I loved how easy it was to install.  It is very strong and will made.  The Stanley peg system worked very good with board they fit tight in the holes.	2
This is a light weigh simple kit to use that has a flawless performance. But I found a video on how to make these yourself and they work just as good if not better and its practically free...[...]	2
works greatI tried smartthings out for a few weeks then got something that better fit my needs for home automation..  Micasa Verde VERA is the better way to go for HA.	2
Awesome little cutter, it does what i bought it for beautifully. Will definately handle up to 16 gauge wire.	2
i have always used the  Klein multibit screwdrivers. my old ones tips were wore out and needed a new one so thought i would try this one the plus side of this one is you get 1/4&#34;, 5/16&#34; & 3/8&#34; nut drivers over the other version. the down side is i dont have and torq bits now.	2
I have purchased several particulate masks at Home Depot and have never found one I liked.  This mask does not fog up my glasses and is comfortable.  The price is less than HD and the replacement filters are inexpensive.  Works great for drywall dust and insulation installation.	2
Works exactly as advertised. Is built well and is of high quality. Definitely recommend for hard to reach items and grasp.	2
I can't say enough good things about this winner.  Super bright.  So easy to operate.  Love the magnet.  Smartly protected from impacts.  Great value.  It took me all of about 5 minutes to earn back in utility and satisfaction the full price I paid for this product.	2
Got sick of using impact driver with cheap ACE bits without detents.  These are incredibly cheap but well made, and works much better than my previous bits without detents.  Works perfectly with my Bosch Pocket and Impact Drivers.	2
Totally identical in every way to the DeWalt battery it replaced. Looks equal in every way. No problem holding a charge. Eventually, all rechargeable batteries for tools will die. We'll see how long this lasts.	2
Works as advertised- it's probably at least as bright as the old Mini-Maglite incandescent flashlights, but only uses a single AAA battery, and is in the Solitaire format that fits on a keychain.	2
This is for the 1/4&#34; shelf pins and not the European one, which is smaller. If you're looking to add existing holes to the shelves you have at home, get the other jig and not this one. I build my bookcases from scratch so this were what I needed.	2
A strong light that produces the &#60;400nM wavelengths needed to use to check for pet stains. A great and invaluable tool.	2
I have a bunch of DeWalt tools and this makes charging 2 batteries at once more simple than it once was. It works for multiple voltage batteries as well...	2
This is an ideal little tool for your pocket. I love it. It is very well made and has some very nice features.	2
I love this tool. Anything Incra is quality. Can make any degree of cuts easy. Just make sure you adjust the guide before you cut so you don't cut it.	2
This might cost a few bucks more than going to Harbor Freight or some other similar store, but it was shipped via Prime and the convenience was worth the effort for me.  It comes with the storage pouch as shown and has come in handy a few times so far.	2
I bought a new house, and got this test.  Taped it to the basement wall for 6 months (and kept the packaging taped next to it so I would not lose it).  Test came back clean.  Nice piece of mind and little cost.	2
Crisp white light from a very flexible holder. Fits Makita's 18v battery pack - not sure of total run time on a fresh battery. LEDs can be full on or reduced by half. Comes with a handy built-in hanger hook as well as a hook on a strap... which is a bit odd. Great, well thought out product	2
It is a good product and does the job that I wanted it to do. Kreg makes good tools. Amen.	2
This headlamp is amazing for the price. Unlike many others, it is comfortable to use and produces a nice strong zoomable beam. It is well worth the money.	2
There's not much to say. When turned on, these are indistinguishable from the incandescent bulbs I replaced with these. The light output is the same, but uses less energy. That's a win in my book!	2
The Power Hands push stick performs much better than home made sticks.  The rubber on the bottom gives enough tackiness to make controlling the cut much easier and more secure.  The push pin adjusts to the thickness of what your sawing.  Comfortable handle for easy pushing and safety.  A good tool to have.	2
Works very well with AA, with TrustFire 14500 this is unbelieveable, definitely the brightest flashlight I have seen with the lion.  I'm not to worried about fire/explosion since this only uses one cell.  Bought two of these, two 14500 batteries, and two handlebar mounts for riding at night and am happy with the results.	2
Used in conjunction with Moultrie 440 Pound Big Game Scale to weight my ultralight.  Very easy to use and connect, The scale's &#34;S&#34; hooks need protection to prevent slipping out of their hoops.	2
This light is surprising bright for an led flashlight as many I have tried are dim or too &#34;yellowy.&#34;  Can't go wrong for the money, especially since they give you batteries with it.I reach for it a lot.	2
I have used the wood blade and like it very much.  I got this pack to see how Id like the rest of the blades	2
This is the brightest Flash light I have ever owned. You shine this into an intruder's face he will see spots for 10 minutes. Lights up a big area. Not something you would carry around in your pocket. Good ion the house or car.	2
These batteries are great after using ni-cads for years. Much lighter, take more charges, Don't have memory so you don't have to drain completely to recharge. Also you can leave them on the charger and not overcharge them.	2
This bulb looks well built and fits perfectly. The brightness and color temperature very closely match the halogen bulbs it's replacing. See my comparison image in Customer Images.	2
I bought this to use as sander for my concrete countertop project. This stone shave down concrete easily wet or dry.Also, I can control speed and pressure when using this stone to grind uneven concrete.	2
Super quick shipping, easy and simple to install as well. Can't wait till tonight to see it lit. Looks great and matches the door knob kit also.	2
I bought this for the filter and love it for the &#34;rain&#34;. I now have one on each of my two showers... My company deserves the best shower they can get... Highly recommended!	2
This little hammer is great, you can choke down on the handle with confidence because the grip is very effective. Its not a framing hammer by all means, but I got this for my EDC tool pouch and will certainly work for prying or light demo. I keep a small zip lock full of nails in case I need them.	2
My sander's (backing) pad disintegrated over the years.  This pad brought my DeWalt random orbital sander back to life!Installation is easy.  The net result is my sander feels like new again!	2
I am all ways looking for some help in reading the small print that is some common today.  So I bought some of these and placed them everywhere I might need them.  This works!!!	2
Excellent quality. Nice color to go with stainless covers and anywhere you have stainless appliances (kitchen).	2
I purchased these to round out my Kreg Jig clamp arsenal.  You can never have too many clamps.  These make assembly go even faster!	2
Makes for clean lines, and you only have to replace one switch,  not the whole bank to toggle switches.  Good for the cost too.,	2
Bought this to check the noise levels of household things like appliances, power tools, mowers, etc.  Gives you a real education on how really noisy things are.  I like this little meter.  Even checked it against an industry standard calibrator, it's pretty accurate.	2
These are great for general dust, such as saw dust, yard work, etc.  I also have a P100 mask from 3M which is great.  For lighter duty these work well enough to not end up breathing stuff you dont need to without the added restriction of air.  Great price over the 2-pack sold in stores.	2
I needed a way to measure the up and down deflection of the control surfaces on an airplane and the Wixey did the job perfectly! With the control surface in trail, I could hit the &#34;zero&#34; button and then measure both the up and down deflection from that reference line.  I'm very pleased!	2
Hey, what can I say? These do the job and they last years!Hey, what can I say? These do the job and they last years!	2
Now this was a deal. Just needed 1 battery. Found this got 2 battery's charger and light. The light alone was worth the ten bucks.	2
Ratchets can be frustrating for many reasons like not fitting your work area.  This extending ratchet is a solid, comfortable design.  It's pairs very well with my stubby ratchet and breaker bar.	2
These little night lights are just what I needed for the hallways near the children's bedrooms. They give off a bright green light that easily illuminates a hallway, but not too bright. Perfect for when you wake up and don't want to blind yourself with the overhead lights.	2
Great for placing in a junk-drawer, kitchen or desk drawer, tool box etc. It is not designed to replace a complete workbench. Performed as advertised. I wouldn't mind having more than one, just in case.	2
Quality product.Easy to set up.No motorized switch to fail like on a Intermatic.I used Intermatic crap timers in my townhouse.  With a new home I decide to do it right the first time.Trust me.  By it 1x and never worry about it again.	2
works great once adjusted.  Required some adjusting of &#34;on&#34; beam on install, but after that worked perfectly and avoids the hard to reach switch now.  Wish they were cheaper I'd buy several more!	2
I needed this type B bulb for my reading light.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It arrived well packaged and works fine.	2
cant go wrong with dewalt  this box is strong and well i need more i used metel boxes and well they rust ande deform if sat or stepped on not this box	2
I love rechargeable units, and this one is fantastic.  Has a long &#34;shelf&#34; life after being charged up.  The brightness is great, and truly goes &#34;out there&#34;.  The money I will save on batteries, will make this free before long !!!	2
Descent flashlight. 1&#34; Dia., 3 1/2&#34; lenght, 3 3/4 extended sleeve focused length.  Nice bright circle spotlight beam. When extended to the focused mode the light goes from a round spotlight to a magnified square emmiting LED, kind of weird but it works. Strong clip for attaching to pocket etc. Rubberized push button on the back end.	2
Almost a necessity with the miter stand for the JawHorse.  Stable, sores well, and extremely flexible tool.  Using it this weekend, actually. Highly recommend!	2
This grout blade works great for removing grout between tightly-spaced ceramic tiles. I have also used it to cut holes through plaster with minimum dust displacement and breakage.  I use my Dremel Multi-Tool frequently, and this blade, along with the 1/16 inch carbide grout blade, makes a nice addition to my selection.	2
This is a great value for the money.. lots of useful bits included and the case is really nice.. each spot for each bit is individually labeled with the bit size.  Can't go wrong with this for how inexpensive it is.  Great for RC enthusiasts.	2
I haven't used this can specifically but it sprays well and goof off is the best stuff around to remove adhesives so have to give it a positive review.	2
this is a quality screwdriver set packaged in a quality made tube with shirt pocket clip. really good for the small fixes.	2
Got it with a nice red pouch. It's very light and compact but once installed, looks unbeatable except maybe a door kick-down.	2
I love hakko products so naturally when I saw this i knew i had to have it for those times when I'm on the go. I used Eneloop batteries and within seconds of charged batteries the iron was hot and it melted my solder. It is a keeper for sure	2
Familiar to TNPers everywhere, the mechanix gloves are more than a simple set of latex or nitiride examination gloves, they are a symbol of being self reliant and kind of a badass. Get some.	2
These are awesome, they take a mere 3 watts and are dipped in Silicone and they seems to emit no heat which is great.	2
Great for making long cuts without moving the item on a tablesaw.  Works well with one hand and gets the other hand out of the way.  Cool item!	2
Snapped it into a Leviton 2-Port wallplate no problem. Works fine.  It's a little difficult to screw the coaxial cable into the back of this.  May want to connect the cable prior to snapping it into the wall plate.  Otherwise no complaints.	2
A well made little flashlight that is very bright for its size.  I am happy with it.	2
Haven't used this saw much yet, but the saw and tray fit perfectly into my Bosch L-Boxx alone with my Bosch 12v drill.	2
This orange color is very vibrant almost irridescent and it adheres well. It is a very striking color when applied and dries fast.	2
I used this kit to make a table for my drill press and it was exactly what I needed. Very good quality and should last quite a long time.	2
I have an Okidata laser printer that has not been feeding paper right for some time now.I used this stuff on the feed rollers and now the printer works fine again.It sure beats buying a new printer.	2
This drill is for light use. It does small to medium load drilling. It will do for household fixes and is great since the battery lasts for months. The charging is fairly quick too.	2
Absolutely amazing. We bought this for our 66 pound hound who is a crazy strong puller and after the first use with the gentle leader my wife is able to walk the 2 dogs together without any hassle or concern. The collar itself is easy to use and adjust. Have had no issues with that.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Excellent popcorn. Cooks well in oil and in an air popper. Very few un-popped kernels per batch. Stored mine in air tight containers to keep out bugs and to prevent over drying that will hinder popping.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love that these are nut free and low in sugar.  I don't feel bad giving them to my kids!  They taste a bit nutty because of the sunflower seeds.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I have 3 of these bowls.  They are durable, dishwasher safe and can hold a lot of food or water.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've never seen our cats chow down on dry food like this before. It's grain-free which is very important and *without* by-products.  A very quality cat food which they think is tasty. Also, NO vomiting issues at all. Will continue to buy as part of their variety of quality foods.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
In the time I have been giving this to my Maltese, I can already see a big difference.  The ugly reddish-brown stains are fading and there are no new stains starting.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The smell and flavor are amazing!  It sampled it straight out of the jar.  That was a dangerously delicious idea.  It's my new favorite oil for pan frying, and when I get some on my hands while cooking, I just rub it into my skin.  Feels so smooth and supple.  :D	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
what would I do without amazon?? this is the only place where I can find all the keurig existing aND the price is great.the coffee tastes awsome, too bad it is limited.smells and tastes like very light coconut in coffee.good buy	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We have three labradoodles and live in WA state. So, we know a thing or two about wet dogs. These towels are beyond amazing! Not only are they super absorbent, but they dry quickly too. A must have for anyone who has to deal with wet pooches. I never knew I could be so thrilled over a towel :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Ive become so addicted to these. I never used to like oatmeal but these are so good! The portion is just right and they're easy to cook,, just pop in microwave. Amazon is cheaper than store and since I eat one every day buying by the case works out great for me.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Not a bad little bowl..they do mean shallow..maybe 1" from rim to the bottom..very heavy duty and a little care, it should last a long time...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My cat has diabetes and I feel these are the best cat wet cat food for his needs and for the price!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I take these on the road with me in my suitcase.  I like to have a bowl of cereal in the hotel room before I start the day.  It's quick and cheap.  I pack it in ice before I go to sleep and it's cold in the morning.  Perfect!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Had heard about the furminator but didn't buy this until we had our dog bathed.  The groomer used it on him and it was amazing how much less the shedding was...so I bought one...my dog loves it too!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Personnaly, I don't care for soft cookies; however my wife loves them...so I got these for her...when queried, she said...not bad...not bad at all...so...wifey gives these cookies a two thumbs up...she still perfers oreos, but these are a very close second.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These chocolate covered pretzel pieces are beyond delicious.  The M&M chocolate is wrapped around the salty pretzel and the combination is delicious and not as caloric as a plain M&M. :)  They were quite popular but are now hard to find-again, I found them on Amazon and have replenished my jars of this candy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Also works good for hard to reach places by the brake caliper too. I use these on all my vehicles with a variety of finishes and with a proper cleaner the grime just scrubs right off.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

We needed something to take care of the litter mess that our cats left behind. After a bit of research I purchased this. It works and described and is easy to shake out and put it back down for more use. You need to be careful about not cleaning it with certain chemicals so read the instructions.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My dog, a hard chewer, loves this toy and hasn't been able to destroy it so far. She tore the black Kong Frisbee within 10 minutes.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My GSD destroyed the other brand in short order.  He cant chew through this one though.  He tries and tries but ball stays together.  Strong enough for a horse, built for a German Shepherd.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I bought it mainly for my lab.  He developed a limp (left knee), and so far it seems to help hem.  Vet thinks it is a genetic problem and I will try anything to help him.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This ball is great.  It is heavy so my dog only plays with it in short spurts, but it lasts and she does line to play with it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
seems to be a well built sturdy fish net. No problems yet. Will definitely catch my little monsters when cleaning out the tank!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is one toy my puppy never gets bored with. I love that it is adjustable so I can control how much food he gets out of it. With it being hard plastic, I don't have to worry about him tearing it up either. This treat ball was a good investment.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This helped me snip some of the matted areas on my older cat.  They are easy to grip and use and were a good price.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This keeps my water crystal clear for my goldfish tank (theres only 2 goldfish but still). Paired with 2 penguin 350's on my 45g, my water is always crystal clear! The one downside is that it didn't come with the coarse foam pad, which isn't a huge deal as AquaTop sells them for $5.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I've been eating these for years and continue to buy them. These are the best canned version of chicken and dumplings on the market, and trust me, I've tried many.

Delicious flavor, very rich chilis...not too too, meaning it will not overwhelm.  In fact, I suppose my one criticism is that it's not as concentrated as I expected, however that can be a plus.  You won't end up choking on too much smoky heaty peppery backtaste.this is VERY smooth.  Like I said - I love it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My papillon puppy could care less about these. I have offered them to her and had them laying out for 5 weekes, has never chewed on them, not even the &#34;chicken&#34; one.

Good for pet rinsing, but also good for other water driven devices - you need to remove the shower head with a pliers.  The diverter head fits before any shower head so you can switch between water flows.  The hose is durable and is about 6 ft long.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

These disappear quickly in my house. Kids love them and they're pretty low in saturated fat. With how fast we eat them up for snacks it's nice to get a big box at a time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The best thing I ever bought! I agree with other posts if you have longer haired or breeds that sheds use this outside.  The 2 speed is powerful enough for me I don't need the b3 b4 or b5 but they are great for various speed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Much better than the generic stuff and a very usable quantity. Great for everything to boost flavor. Nice Nice Nice	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I sent this to my son in college and he asks me to send it every time. He LOVES it, LOVES it, LOVES it!!! I highly recommend this product to everyone. When it is on sale it is a great price for the case as the bottles are 32 oz. so everyone in his dorm room gets their own bottle!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love the taste of this cereal and cant think of anyway to improve it.  I look forward to pouring soy milk over it for breakfast.  It reminds me of honey bunches of oats cereal with pecans.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Good quality and shipped fast. Fits my 2009 Jeep Wrangler. Fit great in my jeep and just the right length and fit into the hitch.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
MMMM Yes all chocolate is good.But some chocolates are better than others and this is a "better than others chocolate"It has a smooth, easy creamy taste not overly sweet IMO.It is just pretty much perfect	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I really like this coffee.  The ONLY reason I don't order this, online, any longer is that I can buy a Bold k-cup coffee at Costco for a whole lot less money.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Works very well for both my cats who have allergies and will scratch tip they bled during a flare up.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Coconut oil has many healthful benefits, possibly preventing alheimers disease and can be used for makeup remover. healthy skin and hair.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is some of the best Waffle mix my family and I have ever eaten. The taste and texture is spot on and it is very healthy for you. Love this stuff! So good!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
America's Test Kitchen rated it best after all their lengthy trials and I can only add my vote for it as well.  There is just no comparison when it comes to pastas, De Cecco will never fail you.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I was skeptical about buying these in a can, but they are every bit as good as fresh. Plain with lemon or with food, you can't go wrong. Plus, the price is right.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Have been ordering Tully's House Coffee since I bought my machine over 2 years ago. Highly recommend you try it just once. Comes in different strengths which makes everyone happy..	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This works perfectly on my cat to control fleas. My cat is an indoor cat but somehow he got fleas. Once I treated him with this the sratching stopped within hours. And I was no longer being bitten. The only problem I have is my cat won't stay still whle I apply it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We have two rescued indoor cats who enjoy playing with this cat toy. One of our cats scratches it to keep her claws off our furniture. We also take care of a feral cat who will step inside to play with the ball and scratch as well. So, three cats love it and have melded their accolades.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The stake is large and sturdy yet easily screws into the ground.  The cable is just long enough and doesn't get hung up around the stake.  We purchased this for camping initially but use it in the front yard all the time.  Keeps our 65-lb dog right where we put him!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My dog had a bladder infection which made her soil the carpet.  After that she forgot her house training because the carpet smelled like a place to pee to her.  After using this she could no longer smell her own pee in the carpet and has remembered her house training again.  Thank goodness!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Convenience factor makes it even easier to choose this option.These cost about $0.7 ea.More important they taste really good. The high temperature/pressure brewing process does seem to extract the best out of s small amount of coffee.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This has a wonderful taste and smell.  You need to use a tea strainer because it's loose tea,  but it's worth the little bit of extra effort.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this 6 months ago and my dog uses it for an over night kennel. I would buy it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This filter looks great and works well. I have purchased two for my 55 gal turtle tank. Its adorable to see my yellow-bellied slider hatch-lings bask on the top of these filters.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I can use it to make mac and cheese or I can sprinkle it on popcorn.  Excellent.Lately, I've been using whole wheat small shells and making my own sauce with this (just add butter and milk).  Then I add some peas and chopped sun dried tomatoes.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I got this sauce thinking it would be something good! Wrong!!  This sauce has no flavor, to me it is like thinned out mayo!  I cannot taste any spice in the sauce.  I wouldn't even rate this as mild, it is just colored mayo!  Did not like, did not taste good, and will not buy again!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I use this in my 55 gallon freshwater aquarium every time I do a water change.  I have never had a problem even after large volume water changes.  This conditioner does a great job making tap water safe for the fish. The 33.8 oz bottle is a great deal.  Thanks Amazon.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Frontline stopped working completely, and both of our cats had a lot of fleas while we waited until enough time had passed to apply Advantage. The day after I applied it, dead fleas were literally falling off of our cats and have been under control ever since.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great yummy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our parakeets love this food, and it seems to be very good for them. I added this product to my Subscribe and Save list.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the perfect rice no matter how you cook it I have cooked it in my rice cooker, stovetop and microwave. And it comes out good every time. I will buy this brand again and recommend it to us.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
my dog doesn't turn her nose up at these. she loves them. but i only give her one every other day to make them last longer. they are a good quality product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We have now been getting this granola cereal on Subscribe and Save and absolutely love it!  It is delicious and has many raisins in it as well.  The cereal needs no sugar as it is already naturally sweet.  Try it...I think you will agree with me!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I think we may have a year supply of popcorn now. A great bargain that we use with our air popper machine.  Always pops, good size and yummy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great product, very tasty!  Very satisfied with this purchase.  Just had to try chocolate Rice Krispy Treats for the first time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My dog is the destroyer of toys! ( 5 year old boston terrier) He chews on this daily and there is hardly any wear to it!  The crunchy noise keeps him interested.  I would buy this again for sure!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My cats love these treats & I'm giving them Lysine in a portable form. Great!  Recommended by my vet for cats with herpes	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Seriously, these are adorable on my two tiny dogs.  Great for walks or just hanging out without being too pretentious.  Just warm and cuddly!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I highly recommend the new green Dentastix.  I was concerned that my doggie might not like them as much as the regular ones she was used to having.  She loved these right from the start and enjoys having one each day.  Great product!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Green beans arrived as ordered.  We like the fact that they are organic and we can order a case at a time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Have always enjoyed this and yes I always add an extra scoop to my coffee maker as like it a wee bit stronger and have always done this and I enjoy the taste	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i mix this with a tiny bit of pure white stevia extract to make a sugar substitute that works cup for cup in recipes! google it to get the exact recipe.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
From all the guys that send their oil out to the labs .. And the studies say that this stuff is the best .. So I use it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a wonderful, satisfying, chocolate product. I am just disappointed that I only bought 2 bags. Time to reorder!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Was exactly what we needed and a lot  cheaper then local pet stores. Product works very well and sent quickly. I like the MV bulbs for my beardy and at this price I save about 20 dollars a bulb.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our dog has absolutely no interest in this.  It's way too heavy and the openings are just too big.  Try a regular Kong or another football type ...  this one just doesn't work.  (our pup is 70lbs and he can destroy a toy in no time)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My Japanese Chin still loves these Nutri Dent Nyla bones. They are one of her favorite treats. They make her breath better also.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Sure, I would rather use fresh onions for cooking all the time but that is not always possible. I also have a few favorite recipes that require 'onion flakes' so they are a pantry staple here. Frontier products are top quality in my kitchen.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Being new using filters and cartridges I have nothing for comparison. They seem to work well, and they don't cause problems that I can see.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This marinade makes the best beef OR chicken fajitas!  Marinade all day in the fridge, grill, then top with your preferred toppings.  Truly restaurant quality.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Cat loves it thinks its a real bird. If you have a cat buy this toy. You will not regret it...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the only stuff I use, and when I do water changes I put 3 caps full in (125 gal) wait 2 min then take the water hose from outside and pump in 20% water. Haven&#8217;t lost a fish yet using this stuff so it works and no need for that filtered water any more.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love that this cat litter is pretty much dust free. It makes a big difference when you have allergies or not! The price is a bit high on this cat litter, but you can't beat having it delivered due to it weighing 40lbs.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
it came on time,..one package, in a brick nice and air tight! way to go! this pack i put up for later, love how they packaged it too!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I used to only be able to get chestnuts for the winter holidays, but when I found these on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to have them. They are a healthy, delicious, filling snack, and I feel very &#34;holiday special&#34; eating them. Microwave x 30 seconds, and enjoy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
wonderful!some pumps are so noisy, not this one. true whisper quiet.we have this set up on a 55 gallon with two bubble wands (12inche) on it.it has enough power to pump through 24 inches.wonderful!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The tall sides go a long way toward shielding my bathroom floor from cat litter.  Some still gets kicked out the front sometimes, but I have yet to find a box with a perfect design.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Dogs love this treat and good for them, good for their teeth, good for them, nice and easy to get them thru the mail	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
just like the sugar ones, but I'd like it if they were more pungent.  Certainly the best brand.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Found these on the net and now i am obsess!!!!!!! i can't stop. I just love anythingthat has coconut. They are a little sweet but still awesome. A must if your trying to change your diet.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I like it...I mounted it on my lawn mower...Even with ear plugs it it will still blow your hat off and make your ear plugs vibrate.!. Giddy-Up.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this lead. It is a high quality product and washes great in the washing machine. The handle is heavy enough to be secure in my hand and the clasp can't accidentally open like the cheaper ones can.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have this on my cereal every day.  I see where this may no longer be available.  Sure hope Amazon brings back this vendor.Almonds are good for you and they help regulate a smooth blood sugar...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this because it has a hook thing on the back so we can go for a walk, I do not like the velcro cause she does not like it, wish you had more of these in different colors. thanks	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Must...not...order....these...so...often...hand moving towards click oh dear here I go again!!!!! Well, I can always share them with friends (which is what I always say)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Sampler packs are the way to go.  I'm rarely in the mood for the same thing over and over.  This provides an excellent opportunity to sample different teas and flavors before deciding on just one.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love nut rolls because the nuts balance the snack and I don't get sugar shock. Baby Ruths have been around a long time for a very good reason. They are real candy at it's best.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I use this leash all the time for my little dachshund.  It works well and I'm still using it.  I like the skinny width and long length.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I use it in my bread recipes every week.  I am living a gluten free, dairy free, egg free, soy free and nut free life	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've used this for my puppy since she started getting de-wormed and she has had no issues with worms or anything her entire life.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My cats absolutely love this toy.  Even the dog tries to get in on the fun.  This entertains for hours and hours!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is great.  Anyone with a cat should should have one of these.  I would recommend this product to everyone!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Really these are so good.  It's hard to stop at a serving size.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I replaced my Sylvania bulbs with these for Low Beams and these are just great!Good vision, white light, great coverage and none of that 'dingy' blue hue...I also bought/used the PIAA 9005 Intense White High Beam bulbs.....	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My cats love them.  I have reordered anumerous times and will continue to do so as they go hrough them quickly	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I was buying bottles half this size at the big W place for $3.98 each. I use these to flavor lattes that I make at home. You can also use them to flavor regular coffee.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Just did not work for my poor, old, anxiety ridden dog. He is ten years old and I guess just too messed up for this to work on him.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have 2 indoor cats and once I introduced Pawbreakers to them, they go crazy for this product.  They keep playing with it non-stop.  My cats approve it and I'm a happy customer :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is some really hot crap! I use it in a bowl of soup, chicken and dumplins, etc. to add some flavor. Poor as little as you can to test. One tiny drip on my eggs is plenty!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i use this leash everyday most days twice.  works great, the lock button seems to be good as I lock and unlock a few times each walk.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are great.  My maltese really loves them and they keep her calm.  I will buy these again and again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My two poodles are doing very well on this food.  I agree with the other reviews that there are cheaper foods, but good ingredients are not cheap.  This food is worth the price.  When they transition to regular dog food, I will buy the same brand.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The pills fall out of the plunger!! Complete waste of money. I bought this on the basis of the good reviews but I was mislead. Horrible product. I was very disappointed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Their tea is awesome! I enjoy that it does not loose it's flavor after a couple of days in the fridge. This is the only tea we buy&#8230;.unless I forget to order it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
it is very slim and you can fit upwards of 20lbs of food in this container.  Very good if you need to keep the food in the house and away from your pets!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
