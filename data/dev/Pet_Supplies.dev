I have purchased 5 of these and they just keep breaking off. Does anyone know a better product to use?	1
Came all broken apart. Not a solid block. No way to hang. It's just a crumbly mess. What a mess. My birds won't even touch it!	1
The Furminator I got was a fake knock-off from China.  The package came from China.  I gave it one stars because it does seem to work.  I am hoping it will last a long time because some people have claim theirs broke after few uses.  WIsh Amazon would quit letting these people sell Knock-Off products.	1
A simple piece of cardboard with different size holes in it that my tiny cat, a  5 pound Singapura (smallest of all cat breeds) flattened in a minute. I didn't have time to send it back or I would have. Total ripoff for the price!	1
I put up with the original one ok, but end up buying the newer version, 4 months later, I just could not take the smell and it getting stuck every time !Do not buy. I 'll prob buy a litter robot when I get a chance.	1
There's this paper crunch sound inside it also. My cat hates it never laid on it, he stretches his arms and legs when I try to place him on it.	1
They don't fit the larger Friskies can. Not the single serving one but the one that looks more like dog food sized. Waste of money :(	1
... and killed my betta fish in his 5 gallon tank due to overnight failure cooling the water down quickly.	1
it says reall chicken but it is not. only few piece real chicken and rest of them by product. my cat was picking only chickens and did not eat others.	1
it does not spark his interest at all, the picture was misleading thought it was flashing lights not a ball....	1
I was expecting a gray mouse but got a yellow mouse that did not look anything like the picture. And then when I put in the batteries it did not work. It is not worth the price to go out of my way to return it but just to say I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!	1
I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THESE NO BARK COLLARS TO ANY ONE BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WORKED. HAVE TRIED 4 OF THEM AND WASTE OF MONEY.SSORRY	1
this is not a fine enough grain litter for my kitty who ended up getting this litter stuck to his longer fur and even to the cute little fur tufts that stick out between his toes ... sure don't want him eating this!  I gave it away quickly to a person with a short-hair kitty.	1
This product does not close well. It seems to be airtight, but it is not. The rubber ring falls off a lot, then it does not shut well at all.	1
Unlike the squeezz ball this was torn up within an hour of it being out of the box. Paid to much for this item for it to be destroyed same day!!	1
I thought it was the wire playpen and the mat/cover. I was sadly disappointed when it arrived and it was not what I thought it was. I am sending it back. They need to package the wire frame and the mat together for the consumer.	1
too tiny even for my 6 lb puppy. I didn't even take the chance of giving it to her.  Perhaps a larger size might have been better.	1
This item didn't last the pup. She had the squeaker broken in a few minutes and I had to throw it out as well because it is easily chewed to bits! Don't waste your money on this junk	1
It is tough to review something that neither of the dogs will even begin to eat so for the critters running through my house gives it a paw down	1
Horrible lead. The clasp, where you pull it down with your thumb to hook to the dog collar, sliced my finger almost to the bone. The nylon part was good though, very nice feel to it. Turned out to be the most expensive lead I ever bought though.	1
We live in Florida, and this has completely stopped working for our dog. It makes no dent in her flea population at all. At one time it did the trick, but either the flea or the product has changed. Look elsewhere.	1
I had no idea of previous reviews that this was a problem but I gave these to my dog & she started throwing up the next day... Nothing in her diet has or had changed. Next day she got another, same problem. Wth?! Throw it away! Don't bother!	1
He is a real pain in the butt! He is a very picky and he is diabetic so I have to watch what he eats. I tried at several different times with this product and he refused to try it.Will have to try something else.	1
I bought this from petsmart for $50. It took about 2 weeks to get to my house - ridiculous. And it doesn't even work. No suction at all...Don't waist your money with this crap.	1
Disappointing, to say the least.  Loved the idea, but the execution is poor.  My dog took it apart immediately and had all the seams open in less than an hour.  He's not even an aggressive chewer.Needs to be much more durable.	1
LOOSE TEETH, ALLERGIES, CHOKING.  BE KIND TO YOUR PET, STAY AWAY. THESE THINGS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET!!	1
The thing burnt out in just a month or two and I feel completely ripped off for a $18 bulb.	1
One of my cats chewed this in have in a couple hours. Not durable at all if your cat is an aggressive player while under the influence of catnip..	1
It's not the best of quality.  I felt even for my 5# Chihuahua, it was still too small for her to lay down comfortably.  And I kept having to adjust/tighten the straps to keep it secure to the seat.  Like they say, you get what you pay for.	1
I have other KONG toys and thought I couldn't go wrong with this Braidz toy. My mistake. My corgi ripped off its limbs within a few hours. Not durable at all.	1
My dog is diabetic and is a very picky eater so that might be part of the problem right there. I set in front of him and usually he gobbles it up but not with these. Had kind of a strange smeel too but most of these dog vitamins do.Try something else!	1
I have a 67 pound rottie mix.  She destroyed this thing in a couple of minutes by pulling off the arms.  Now I keep finding the plastic squeaker inserts all over the place.	1
These treats came up under a search for "Made in the USA" they were NOT they are made in China and also treated with irradiation....not that any of that matters since ALL 3 bags were FULL of MOLD!! SO NASTY!! I called the company and they have yet to even call me back after my initial conversation with their receptionist.	1
I returned this immediately, because it was WAY too bright for my 2 gallon tank. It scared my fish, Snowflake. I bought a new one, after I returned this one...the Finnex Might Ray 21 LED light, and it's perfect.	1
A friend of mine used one of these to train her dog and it worked for her.  It did not work for me.  When I used it on my dog it made him run away from the yard even faster.	1
Loved it for few minutes, I have a 10 lb. dog, she is tough with toys, however this one lasted about 10 min, immediately she tore the seam between the shoulder and neck, which means all the stuffing starts to come out and is no good. Was not put together well.	1
My birds, budgies, liked it while it lasted, but it didn't last very long.  It has small plastic parts, so there is no way it was meant to last long, but I was hoping for more than a week!	1
My cat plays with these a little bit but gets bored because it only lights up if I apply force to it. It only works for him if he slams it into the wall. Waste of money.	1
Yesterday the end that has the latch on it, the wire just popped right out and my 55 lb. golden retriever was loose. There was no pulling, the cable just fell out of the latch. I can't recommend this for anyone, that was very scary for me since we live right next to a road.	1
This product constantly gets stuck and does not work properly.  I recommend the Wahl Touch Up Trimmer instead. They cost the same but the Wahl product outperforms the Conair on every level.  The Conair  Dog Palm Battery Powered Micro-Trimmer is a waste of money.  HATE IT!	1
Awful air pump.  I highly recommend steering away from this product unless you really enjoy returning products and waiting for replacements.  Amazon, as usual, made the ordeal as smooth as possible.  I ended up ordering the hydrofarm air pump and have been very happy with it.	1
I bought for my dog to run with him and it just snap after he was running next to me... so the concept is good but reality for a dog it need to be stronger and better quality.  So I wouldn't recommend expending your money on this. You are better off getting a neck collars that has reflection.	1
I am the proud owner of 12 cats that I have rescued.  Not a single one of my cats would eat these.	1
It failed after a few months. The flexible handle that you start the siphon with loses it's vacuum after several uses. I would recommend something else.	1
I ordered these thinking they were healthy!  Since ingredients were not listed I assumed they were healthy! Grains and other additives that I am avoiding for my senior cat! If you want to avoid additives, don't buy this product.	1
Gave this to my two puppies (one is 50+lbs other is 70+lbs) & it was destroyed in about 1 hour of tug-o-war. I'm disappointed...read other reviews and thought this would be perfect for my puppies.	1
Thats what my dogs apparently think about these because I have 2 Labs and a Golden and NONE of them would eat these. Not sure why they disliked them so but it was a waste of money.	1
the vet beleives that giving my dog this food every day made him sick. (1 year old, 12 pound yorkie) but he loves it.  I have to give away the stockpile I had.	1
AKC is associated with the United States, yet this product is made elsewhere. It seems as though AKC is using their "American Kennel" brand equity to push foreign made treats on our dogs. I'm never buying this brand again--in fact returning it. When will these companies learn we love our dogs and refuse to be duped.	1
She wasn't even interested for a few minutes, she paid no attention.  Perhaps because it is only attachable with a magnet, it may be because it wasn't in a better place to catch her attention, but it wouln't attach to a thin plastic table, or an even thinner wooden one, so, really, what is it made to attach to?	1
She just doesn't eat them. I thought they were cute and might be a nice change of pace, but she just doesn't like them. Your pet might, and for this low of a price, it's worth a try.	1
This is a decent size for a less than 8lb cat. Every time my cat jumps on it, it shakes really bad. It is a nice product, it just isn't sturdy at all. The screws in between pillars just aren't long enough. And the included toys are very cheap and he ripped them off in about 10mins.	1
Not at all to my cat's liking. She was curious about it once and hasn't gone near it since even when I pour catnip on the thing.	1
got this heater for a 40gal tank.it's struggling to keep the tank on the highest setting which is 86* kind of regret buying this heater..maybe i should of got the Fluval E or this Aquatop heater for 16$ something on amazon	1
For some reasons, both of my dogs hate this brand of supplements.  I have a german shepherd and a toy poodle.  Neither of them would eat any of the bio spot supplements.	1
My dog didn't like this product at all.  I have bought other products from this company but unfortuanetly this one he didn't care for.	1
took mouse off card and saw the plastic tab that said to pull to activate squeak ... I did and ... it did NOT squeak.  Cat batted it around for a couple of minutes then walked away.  Has not returned to toy since.  I think it would have helped if the squeak worked...	1
akward and leaks horrible. Not for big dogs either. packaging states not to &#34;squeeze bottle&#34; a normal water bottle is so flimsy now it is hard not to squeeze the bottle. :(	1
I DID NOT FEEL THEY WERE SAFE TO GIVE MY FAMILY DOGS. THE DOGS ARE LIKE OUR KIDS DO NOT WANT A VET BILL. I THEW THEM AWAY. THEY HAD SPLINTERS. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.	1
Wayyyyy too heavy.  It's a short leash with a small clip, so it is probably being used for a small dog.  No need for it to be so heavy.  It's fine as a junky chain if you have to tie-up a leash chewing dog for short amounts of time.	1
Sheesh, I have a ton of Frisbee's now! This is so light it goes nowhere! Plus it tends to go either right or left, not straight at all! Uber light!	1
THIS IS NOT USA MADE, although it is stated that it is. RETURNED THE PRODUCT. My dog sometimes would not eat it, so I looked on the back at the bottom in fine print, it is from China. I will not feed my dog polluted food!	1
Total waste of money. Flings poo out of the box, and gets stuck in modest pee clumps. You will live to regret this purchase, I guarantee it.	1
I bought this in the pet store - both the spray and granules.  The cats lay right on the area treated. Are you sure it's a repellant?? OR ATTRACTANT!	1
The mat did not cool when my puppy lay down on it. Worse, she chewed off a piece within five minutes of getting the mat. The plastic is thin and a choking hazard. I loved the concept and wanted to have it for her spay surgery, so I am really disappointed at having to return it.	1
I thought these would be a nice alternative to a lot of the junk that is out there for dogs. I was wrong, my pup ended up at the vet after eating these with severe bowel distress. No thanks nylabone!	1
Maybe it's the weird shape and the fact it doesn't firmly stay on the floor, but my cats won't go near it.	1
I have 4 dogs.  None of them took any interest in this item.  Maybe if I put peanut butter on this thing they may mess with it long enough to lick it off.	1
Definitely won't be getting these again. My dogs really liked them BUT they are MUCH smaller than pictured/lasted 1 minute flat AND they are made in China. They are NOT worth 10 bucks.	1
For a small betta heater I guess it's fine that there's not a temperature adjust, but this unit is just extremely cheaply made. That combined with the really short cord, and one flimsy suction cup to secure it are reasons that I will never get this again or recommend to anyone.....Oh yea, and it broke after 2 weeks.	1
Zaps pretty strong, made me jump! However, it only works sometimes. It came in the same box as another model from a different company which also didn't work. Not sure how to prevent that again.	1
Very poor quality. My dog destroyed this toy within minutes. The squeakers are enclosed in plastic wrap that easily cause a breathing hazard. I returned it. Do not buy!	1
This price is too high. I can, and do, purchase this product from Walmart for $15.68.  Amazon should do a price comparison to the local stores to adjust prices on this product and give its customers a break.	1
This showed up today, it got put on my sister's dog at about 12pm, it's now almost 11pm on the same day and half the rhinestones have fallen out. Absolutely NOT worth the money. Do not buy!	1
This toy has a strong rubber smell.  Perhaps that is why she won't touch this.  We've offered it to her on many occasions from 8 weeks to 17 weeks, and she is not interested at all.  Too bad, because it looks like this would be great for teethingwith all the different textures.	1
I bought this because the price seemed fair and I wanted my dogs to have some variety. Unfortunately, it didn't sit well with my dogs at all. Caused stomach upset and after a while they just wouldn't eat it. I also noticed tear stains appearing after several weeks of feeding them this. I definitely will not purchase this again.	1
This did not show pet urine stains at all ... Period. Returned it for a better product which immediately showed the stains I was looking for. Don't waste your money.	1
Pump holder plastic clam shell broken immediately. Hard to set pump in correctly after cleaning.stainless bowl only good thing. Pump was weak and didn't flow well. Filters about worthless were placed as didn't help protect pump. I went back to drinkwell system.	1
Not very tall.  We sent it back as we knew our kitty would not like it at all.  It way too small.	1
This product didn't really work. Cat was still urinating where the product was placed. Still was an issue so I used vinegar and water to spray on affected area.	1
I bought this at Bed and Bath and returned it the next day. My older poodle Shepherd mix couldn't get the slider piece to move so she chewed at it and it became very wet. This is made from some kind of fiberboard, not wood.	1
It's not a ball, it's not a stuffed toy, there's no catnip...Basically it's glued on fabric over a ball with a rattle inside.My cat has absolutely NO interest in this toy whatsoever...	1
I used this product in my planted 55 and 29 gallon tanks with no noticeable difference. Yes, the water clouded, and cleared, but it did nothing that the bacteria that are growing on my sponge filters and inside the Fluval filters aren't doing already.	1
Used this product once and my dog broke the string. It is also very bulky dangling around the neck. I would not recommend this item, just use a traditional collar and leash.	1
My rabbit broke one slat.  I broke 2 more.  It's cute andit works but it is so narrow that when you stuff hay in it you put stress on the slats.  I worried about my rabbit having one as it looked like there was glue.	1
i do not think this product does anything to calm my anxious dog that I rescued from the SPCA. I have wasted my money on this.	1
Bought it for my animals, but they never would lie on it.  And then it leaked even though they never used it.  Threw it away eventually	1
This has to be the worst chicken snack I've ever purchased.  Very disappointed.  My buddy loves chicken snacks and he hatedthis product.  This thing was super dry and smell like it was in the warehouse for decades.  AVOID it.	1
Please be aware that all "Ideal Balance" treats contain chicken even does of fruit and cereals. Verify the ingredients because if you have an alergic dog this is not for you.	1
It didn't work for us we had to send it back we only got a signal 15 feet from the house.	1
gotta give it to my dogs daily for it to work	1
My dog had this torn into , shredded , unstuffed and the squeeker out in record time. :( Was cute toy while it lasted. Would not purchase again!	1
I buy bully sticks for my dogs all the time. All made in USA. But this brand? They turn their noses up at them. They sit on the floor untouched. So I've got 25 of these suckers that were really quite expensive (they are quite nice and thick, BTW) that my dogs won't chew. I'm really bummed out!	1
As too many of the other reviews said, it arrived today with a huge crack on it, hopefully the replacement will be OK, one more try I guess.	1
Poor quality!  Didnt even stand up to one washing before the entire bottom disintegrated.  Our 19 year old chihuahua did like the softness and fill, but the lack of durability gives this bed a bad review	1
Uhhh, since these treats state right on the front of the bag that they do not contain peanut oil or paste, what DO they contain?  There is NO PEANUT BUTTER in them!	1
I thought I would get this because I have a small dog and he would be able to get to the marrow easier.  Well it is much smaller than I thought and the dog barely chews on it.  I bought another kind and the dog took to it over this one.	1
My cat isn't attracted to it even when I'm brushing his body and he likes to rub his head on something he doesn't use it.  The bristles are too short and hard on the bottom and he doesn't like the feel of the rubber mat.  He only uses the teeth chew, and the other piece at the top.	1
i followed the directions but every time i used this on either one of my dogs, they vomited right after and gagged for a few hours afterwards. i ended up throwing it away.	1
I think these are the only treats my dog actually spit out and refused to eat. I don't know about other dogs, but mine wanted nothing to do with these. I was disappointed, because I was sure she would love them because she really likes fresh fruit. Oh well, live and learn.	1
I try and play with is as much as I can. Its really cool to watch her play with it. Make sure you are working with treats your dogs really likes.	2
Best food on the market and he prefers it to other dry food choices.  No corn or gluten - tasty and healthy.  It is worth the extra cost.	2
I love this product and so does my kittie!  Just perfect and exactly what we were looking for!  Thank you!	2
I use the big dog ones for the large tablets and the small cat ones for the dog's 1/4th pill dose.  Works every time.	2
i would recommend to people my 5 cats take turns using it,i put it in front of my bedroom window so they can lay on it look out the window and get fresh air all at the same time	2
I have 8 cats , some eat this other like the other flavor.  They all love the moist tender centers!They all like the indoor flavor as well.	2
This pump runs very quiet and has lots of power.  i have a 100 gallon tank and its almost too strong for it.  i would recommend the wave timer that can be purchased along with it.  I have great current in my tank and the fish love it.	2
The toy is very sturdy but unfortunately my dog always rips out the stuffing for the  chipmunks.  He still plays with the un-stuffed chipmunks and  the log.	2
Umm, yummy, is what my dog says every time she gets one of these.  It's one of her favorite treats to eat.	2
This works and works quickly, Have a puppie who likes the living room carpet and this does the job, It is great, Will buy more if needed	2
I bought the KONG BINKY with the dry treats. She plays for a while but not real interested. Started putting peanut butter in and WOW!! What a great babysitter!!	2
I purchased this large bag by accident, thinking I was buying a smaller bag like I usually do.  However, it will last a long time and is kept fresh because of the design of the bag and the &#34;zip&#34; closure.  Even though I had made a mistake, it was well worth it!	2
works great.....i have used it for over a year and my dogs and cats never show any signs of fleas	2
My GSD loves playing with this! I put her kibble in it and she goes crazy for it and goes after it for 15 minutes or more sometimes!Very happy with it!	2
I got this for my dogs, dog food and it holds a full bag. It works great for it. The upper part I use for storage of other stuff.	2
Well, all of my babies love this food.  They are sometimes a bit picky, but this food was a sure fire hit!  It is in pate form, but you can see the veggies.	2
All three of our fenlines love this flavor of Friskies......and our bulldog even begs for a taste.  It's a winner all around.	2
Does not replace regular maintenance and water changes, but is a quick way to help ensure water stays healthy for my turtles.	2
I love this bowl. It is quiet, and no water splashes out like the raindrop design. It is definitely large, but still need to clean it every 2nd or 3rd day because of slime. It stays cleaner than plastic.	2
My dogs really loves these but they are a bit smelly. I didn't realize what these really were until recently.	2
Not only did my Kiki like this toy but so did my three dogs. I would find the dogs playing with it and had to take it away from them many times.	2
This product smells great without being overwhelming. It soothes my dog's itchy winter skin and makes his coat feel amazing. He's never been softer or shinier!	2
I purchased this for the dog igloo that I bought for my sisters dogs at Christmas.  This really helps them stay warm.The item was received very quickly and in perfect condition.  Great product, great service.	2
This works great. It's simple to clean, and fits easily in a standard size bowl. Not pictured is the &#34;Omega Paw&#34; logo that's stamped into the ball, it makes it harder to clean, but it totally does the job.	2
I still use these as my dog is not 100% outdoor potty trained. They work well and are super absorbent.	2
They like sitting on it and scratching on it.  I like that once one side gets mangled, I can turn it over!  I only wish I could now turn it inside out.  :)	2
works like it should.  black to hide with the black background.  dont really nottice it in the tank.	2
This is a really large collar. Make sure your dog can handle it! Our English Bull Terrier is 35 pounds now, but will have to wait till he's bigger before this will work well for him.  Great collar though.	2
I have two cats. One of them is in this at almost all times. They have other scratchers, other boxes, but this one they seem to love above all else. I don't even use the catnip. I will be purchasing this again.	2
These were a gift for my &#34;Grand dog&#34; Charley.  He LOVED them!!  My son and daughter in law were happy with the product and plan on buying more.	2
Our Coton de Tulear is addicted to Angel Eyes. Every morning he will make a grunting sound until he gets this product. It is funny because he doesn't do this on anything else. As far as his eyes they have improved immensely. No more tear stains on his face!	2
they were alot cheaper than buying them from the pet store we have and our dog loves them. would recommend them for dogs that love to chew on their treats.	2
Extremely excellent product! this takes care of doggie ear problems and does it very timely! within a few days! will not use anything else for the ears!	2
No problems with product whatsoever! Have used this product on multiple dogs for multiple years. Won't buy anything else!Great price with free shipping options.	2
The bed is shipped tightly rolled and takes some time for it to lay flat, etc.  The directions do state this and it worked for me.  It appears to work quite well and I have no complaints.	2
Love, love, love these little scissors. I have a toy poodle and they are a safe way to trim hair away from her eyes. Rounded ends make me more comfortable to keep her groomed.	2
I found two little girl puppies abandoned in the desert.  I scooped them up and took them home.  They have grown and have needed new collars.  These collars are perfect.  So, when one chewed up the collar of the other I bought replacements.	2
Not the healthiest cat food, I know.  My cats will eat nothing else and I have tried everything.  So, Friskies it is.  I like them to have wet food as to mix in the Lysine.	2
My kitten loves climbing all over this lounge... she loves scratching it and so far this is all she scratches.  Perfect item.  I would recommend this product to anyone with cat or kitten.	2
This is a constant  staple in my dog treat cupboard. These are great.Read my previous reviews on this product:-)	2
My Bulldog generally tears up toys pretty quickly.  I have had good luck with the Kong toys not fall apart and last a long time.	2
I did not run across these little gems until I adopted my current puppy.  My vet recommends them as a limited ingredient food.  My puppy loves them!  He will do almost anything to get one.  They keep better than softer treats and are real easy to stuff in your pocket for training!Wonderful product!'Barbara	2
My Kitties(Tuffy and Silki) LOVE this stuff. They will eat other food they are less fond of if I put a tablespoon of this on it. It's got to be the all time fave!	2
I have two puppies.  A Corgi puppy and a black lab puppy.  They love this toy, but still have yet to de-stuff it like they do many of the other toys I have bought!	2
I love this, it seems to work instantly. It has lufenuron+nitenpyram. The lufenuron kills fleas that bite them and the nitenpyram  repels the fleas from their skin. My cats actually don't mind eating this because it is a tuna flavored capsule. Directions are easy and the results are wanted. Will definitely be buying this again.	2
This company has it all figured out. Love that they continue to come out with new ideas.This is a great ball for kids to kick around outside with their dog.	2
Great toy. Rugged and lasts.	2
The supplied catnip is kitty chronic for my cats. This item is great and seems to be very well made. I will buying this item again, if my cats destroy it.	2
I have a cat, not a dog.  I need these bags daily to contain the contents scooped out of the litter box, since I only change the litter once a week.  Keeps things tidy and controls the smell.  Just what I needed at a reasonable price.	2
You'll wish you never purchased this and were nave to what your dogs and/or cats have been doing around your house. However if you plan on cleaning your carpet, you should know what areas have been hit and this little light will tell you.	2
I consistently buy grain free, organic, or nutrient fortified pet products. They generally carry more of an odor, especially the fish based products. This container holds even the larger bags of feed , and absolutely no odor escapes! The wheels make it easy to tote around as well.	2
My cats adore these toys - they carry them around, sleep with them, and fight over who gets to sit near them.  I've made homemade catnip sacks in the past and these are much cuter and durable - I would highly recommend!	2
My two cats love this.  There are other flavors they are less keen on, but this is a tried and true variety.  They have been eating this for about 5 years now.	2
this works great, no need for anything fancier. I clip this to her harness in the truck and give her enough room to move around in the backseat a bit but she is still safe	2
If you're training a Pet, you need their attention.  These treats are healthy for a puppy, grabs a puppies attention with the noticable scent of the treat, and are perfectly sized for a puppy's mouth.  Easy to tear to make one treat last a few exercises.I recommend these!	2
My cats love this treat! The size is well worth the money. A good value especially since they like the little treats!	2
At first she didnt like it but she has gotten use to it.  Easily trims nails down in seconds; able to round off the tips so she doesnt scratch my floors.	2
My dog just goes crazy for this ball. It's soft on the outside but crackles on the inside. Good for self play or fetching.	2
Works great and is very accurate. It does take several minutes for the thermometer to adjust to the temperature of the tank.	2
My cats play with this for hours. All of the squeaking toys made by this company are terrific. Your cats will love it.	2
I have a coon hound and this is perfect for her since she loves to run however doesn't have the sense to come back when called.	2
Our cat is hard to entertain (doesn't like any of the typical cat toys), and we went through quite a selection of toys that eventually ended up in our local Animal Shelter's donation box ... until we discovered DA BIRD! :) Our cat LOVES it and can't wait for us to get it out and going for him.	2
my cats (3) 2 adults and a kitten, just love this toy, i frequently hear it being batted around in the middle of the night, and poof change the shape and its a new toy, highly recommend	2
We adopted a seven year old cat and even though she was a sweetheart, there were a few things that made her nervous.  This settled her right down.  It even cleaned up her coat.  I really recommend this	2
my puppy loves this ball and he usually can tear something up very quickly... this ball is still going strong...very great for indoor play due to soft and we love it on those rainy days when we can't get outside	2
Fabulous price.  Works as designed.  I use this clipped onto a harness and buckled into the seatbelt.  It is adjustable to allow for a lot of room to move around, or can keep the dog in place.  I was surprised at how easily my dogs accepted being buckled in.	2
This collar is very well made. The fabric's color is so vibrant. I have washed the collar a couple of times and it is still bright with color. Looks great on my dog too!! ^..^	2
Works very well with our 1.5 gallon tank for our Betta. Keeps the temperature right in the &#34;comfort&#34; zone for tropical fish.	2
My senior dog is addictive to these snacks. I've previously given him a different brand before but he prefers this brand instead. Highly recommended, It also comes in a small size and large size, very convenient.	2
I don't think you can get a better light for the money then this. Its all it says it is arrived in perfect shape and fast. Will be buying another one for my next tank.	2
My dog would eat these constantly if he could. NEVER gets tired of them.	2
My cats know the sound of this bag and come running.  They love these.  The bite size tidbits are perfect.  They also like the Catnip flavor as well.  I prefer a mixed variety purchase but these worked.	2
I buy the nylabones on amazon since they are cheaper than the pet store by us and my dogs love them.  My two dogs would rate this a 10 star.	2
For two cats Christmas gift hours of fun. Like that you can add more pieces and other toys for entertainment.	2
More is better when it comes to having a good supply on hand for those frequent puppy accidents - be prepared!	2
Very high sides for aggressively digging cats, keeps litter in the box not on floor.  No top so my cats are not scared of it.	2
Easy to apply and it really does work.  You only need to use it a little bit and use other ear cleaners to keep ears healthy.  I used to have to get this from my vet.  I love Amazon!	2
I got this as a Christmas present for my American Bulldogs. They love it already. It's durable and will hold up to their chewing. The price was great and the item arrived quickly. Definitely something I recommend for owners of large dogs that are heavy chewers.	2
My dog loves this product. No more struggling to get her to take pills. Now she looks upon pill taking as a treat. Excellent product!	2
We haven't actually used it yet as our vet was treating our dog with cortizone first. However, I will be glad to use this in the future instead of the temp collar that cost like $24 from the vet and had really taken a beating. Item arrived in great shape and very quickly.	2
This is a nice little pump... for 10 bucks and the flow and head pressure it can't be beat... I have 2 being used in a 20 gal. High Pointed at each and gives a good amount of turbulance	2
This is the first heater I've used with a temperature set feature that actually works. It's super reliable and makes it simple to keep water at a specific temp. It's a &#34;set it and forget it&#34; kind of thing, which is nice.	2
This is a great stylish traffic leash. Well made and durable. I think it will last me a long time.	2
Prompt arrival. My dog loves these. Good for training. Especially when they learn what the word, treat, means;-)My dog is a now, 8 month boxer and these are just barely a snack for her now, as opposed to a few chews when she was smaller. I can`t see a dog not liking this product.	2
My dogs love playing with an empty water bottle and this toy sounds just like one. They really love it.	2
We feed both canned and dry cat food. The canned is the inexpensive Fancy Feast. My cat actually prefers to eat her dry Merrick Before Grain Salmon. She'll lick the gravy off the canned, but then lets it sit and eats her dry. She loves this stuff.	2
These last me quite awhile. I use one right on my dog's collar for evening/night walks. Bright enough but not horrendously obtrusive. I recommend it.	2
I HAVE A 45 LB. DOG.  SHE LOVES ANYTHING THAT SQUEAKS.  THIS TOY HAS 16 SQUEAKERS IN IT.  SO FAR, IT HAS LASTED 10 MONTHS.  NO RIPS.  SHE LOVES IT.  I BOUGHT A SECOND ONE THAT IS A DOG.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.	2
My Betta gobbles this stuff up. I would recommend small bits at a time, as the brine shrimp dissolves and breaks apart in the water.	2
These dog grooming scissors are wonderful.  You get 4 pair for less than what 1 pair would cost elsewhere.  The various sizes work for any job.  I bought these primarily for mat removal.  Sharp and professional, they do the trick.  I recommend these to any novice dog owner.	2
Darn cats love, LOVE!!!, only gravy so this is the closest I can come to cat food gravy!  Wish they would make JUST the gravy cause I would buy a ton of it!	2
My dog Augie loves this toy. He hasn't destroyed it yet and throwing in the wash every once in awhile makes it like new. My dog isn't a big chewer/plush animal destroyer, but I've had other dogs that were. I think this toy would have made it at least longer than other brands.	2
As soon as it was opened and ready, Miss Kitty was in it chasing imaginary things. She loves it. Well worth the money for her fun.	2
Both the dog and cat love these. The odor is a bit strong but it hardly matters since they're gobbled up so quickly!	2
My cat is a savage so that these de-wormers tasted like chicken saved my having to put a pill in her mouth and loosing lots of blood and skin during the process. Also they worked very quickly and didn't seem to have any adverse effects on her digestive system.	2
Quality product. Dogs love it. Especially glad that it is easily digested for one of the dogs that was having problems with other dry dog food products. Highly recommended to family and friends.	2
Waggin' Train Smoky Jerky Treats, Made with Real Chicken and a Hint of Brown Sugar, 3 ounceMy big babies loved these! My german sheperds actually are picky and turn down treats or food at times if it doesn't meet their high standards. They loved these!	2
Made in Germany all you need to know they hold up to two 120lbs Black Russian Terriers , no problemo. Mine last about five years under heavy daily stress sometimes longer. I use them EVERYDAY ....also use them for tracking and on obedience routines for recalls.Excellent made. I also have the strap model but its heavy for daily use.	2
Packaging was crappy but the product was not damaged.  I have now used it for two days.  I really hope it works for my cat.  I cannot afford the expensive stuff the vet wants me to try.  Keep your fingers crossed..	2
Great little scossor for little dogs. Can trim in little &#34;delicate&#34; areas for hygiene, too.They are very sharp which make for quick trimming without hairs being pulled.	2
this is a healthy, delicious and useful product, the only regret is the plastic packaging but the product is nice. Hope you like it	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I bought three other drivers before I settled with this product. The drill has great power with a light and two batteries that only take 30 minutes to charge.

I have been trying to loose some baby weight, so instead of eating white rice, we switched to brown/wild. This blend is fantastic and a good price for what it is.

My Grandchildren love these Kellogg's Apple Jacks Cereal. If there is milk in the house these do not last long. If no milk they eat them plain. Needles to say before a wk. is past the cereal is gone.

If you are in a hurry or simply do not feel like making pancakes from scratch, this is really the best way to go.

I was honestly surprised how good these are.  I'm allergic to gluten and I have found that most commercial gluten free cookies and muffins are too sweet, but not these cookies which are nice and chewy.

I have to admit that I was surprised at the powerful beam that this LED bulb produced in my Mag Lite flashlight.

For those who love the flavor of ginger tea, this can't be beat. Its 100% pure ginger, brews up with quickly (1 bag will even manged two mugs worth), and gives a clean pallet cleansing flavor.

I was skeptical because every other vanilla tea I've tried didn't live up to expectations. There was always something off, like it was just black tea with a dash of vanilla extract or something.

I drink about 4-5 cups or more of tea a day and have probably tried over a hundred varieties of teas over the years and this is one of my favorite teas.  I like the smell of this tea and it tastes even better.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It is a good product. Very healthy addition to people that are health conscious. There are so many products on the market and this one is good.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I can open or close and check the status of my garage door from anywhere. Easy to setup and great options. The app is better than the Craftsman version. Liked with MyQ technology without any issues.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought these just to cut plastic cable ties. I needed a cheap cutter for that job. These are good enough to cut wire, but I only use them for plastic ties. They do cut perfectly flush and smooth.Good fit size in my hand with a spring action return. Very comfortable to use.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I like to bake and also use cinnamon in cereal and smoothies.This is excellent tasting cinnamon and like the price.  Rather have quality and price than pay extra for packaging (like bottles).  Once the bag is opened, I store the cinnamon in a large mason jar.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the baking powder I use for my regular baking. It's reliable and aluminum free. Using this, along with a bit of baking soda makes the lightest, fluffiest buttermilk biscuits I've ever made. I have found that adding a teaspoon of vinegar to anything I make with this seems to make it rise lighter.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I had to tighten the lights on the front of the unit, but after I did they worked fine.  Other then not knowing about this, I love this product.  Rock solid and performs very well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Everything I actually use in a multi tool and none of the stuff I don't. Great just as a lock blade pocket knife too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Have one of these in every room. As soon as the power goes out, the unit lights up and you can then go grab it off the wall and use it as a flash light. Never have to worry about fumbling around looking for a light source. Great safety device.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great little portable unit.  I like the fact that it also has two connections.  It is relatively quiet too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Quick and reliable. This is far better than the test strips because it is reusable and more reliable. Just dunk in the water and push the button, instant readout.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So happy with these. These are a must try for the sugar free people out there. In fact my husband likes these better that the regular ones. I found a fantastic (Alton Brown) recipe for gluten free chocolate chip cookies that when using these taste just like the regular recipe.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My husband LOVES Raisin Bran and Raisin Bran Crunch. Amazon's price couldn't be beat! We received them in record time and in great shape. The boxes were fresh and delicious. We will be ordering again!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I am usually disappointed by gf lasagne, either the noodles fall apart in the water or you cannot eat it the next day.  Surprise!!! - not only do these noodles not fall apart, you don't have to precook if you don't want to - you can have leftovers - we did for two days!!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Replaced my empty salt grinder with this salt and am happy. The crystals are large and stay inside the grinder so no more salt mess under the grinder from smaller flakes/grains. The flavor is excellent too. I will buy it the next time I run out!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I just tried these for the first time, and I thought they were yummy.  If you need a quick, nutritious snack or breakfast on the go, these are a good choice.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a nice smooth tasting decaf coffee, not at all strong or bitter. My box actually had 51 K-Cups in it so I got a cup on the house. I will be buying this Green Mountain Vermont Country Blend again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My new favorite!  A few Gr. Mtn. are great: Br. Blend, Half/Caff especially.  Most other brands are more like Folgers than real flavor brews.  How do I get free shipping?	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
If you enjoy hard candy and love the taste of coffee this is the sweet for you.  Great tasting candy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Love the french roast beans!  Soo much better to grind them yourself and enjoy the freshness!  Recommended for anyone who like a good, dark cup of coffee.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the first time I tried this chili.  I was pleasantly surprised to find real cubes of beef, chunks of tomato, celery, corn, onion and peppers.  As close to, or better than homemade.  I will repeat buy this grilled steak chili with beans.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We enjoyed this our first order this way and the price WAS great...  We have a limited budget and the reoder price has put this out of our reach...  SAD..	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Very neccessary item for those little job with the drill motor around the house and for those little jobs outside too	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I order these parts because I wanted to break up the solid color of the front end.  These make a great addtion to the front and installation was very easy.  The fit is very good and they stay in place.  I like the new look with them in place.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've tried MANY brands and varieties of gluten free pasta. I have to say, this Barilla one ranks at the top. It cooks up just like wheat pasta, and doesn't get mushy or lose its shape when tossed with sauce. The taste is just like regular pasta. I will definitely be buying more.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is one of my favorite comfort foods.  I have enjoyed it from childhood, and continue to enjoy it.  It was nice to get a great deal on it delivered to my door (although 15 at one time was a bit much)!  I have tried most variations on this, but always come back to this favorite.

If you change your own oil on a late model Toyota you will need some way to remove the oil canister.  This little gem is does the trick.  It is well built and worked great for me.  Now I can save time and $ by changing my own oil.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've always purchased another brand of coffee flavoring but since tasting this one, I've switched brands.  This is not just a watered-down syrup.  This is strong and a little goes a long way!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

As I said in a review of the Kohler Pressure Balancing Unit, this self-install saved me big bucks and was easy. I now have a dripless faucet and money saved in plumbing expenses.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This bulb produces a nice glow with nearly the lowest energy usage (3 watts; I've found one at 2 watts as well) of any bulb I could find. Perfect for fixtures wanting a soft white light output rather than reading light levels. Not a dimmable bulb.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These Z-wave thermostats are work great and seem very reliable and built solidly. They were very easy to wire as well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I find Gorilla glue to be worthless. I've tried it on more than a handful of applications and it literally never sticks very well or very long. I'm going back to carpenter's glue. I know it will perform much better.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This right priced lamp really works well and has a soft feel to it. The three way switch allows for maximum light. Good value for your money.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I really got tired of buying expensive, 3-way 100' cords for my crews.  Finally realized that I could buy less expensive 100' cords and buy this 3-way adapter.  Has saved me a fortune already.  Highly recommend to anyone who needs three things plugged in at once.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

We love the variety of snack you get in this large 36 piece package. The variety pack means we are no stuck with just one type cracker or flavor for a long period of time.
