What happened to the original silver colored Pike Place Roast coffee?  My recent orders in my account has been replaced by Medium Pike Place Roast which I never ordered?  And all the reviews prior to this review of mine belonged to that original Pike Place Roast, not the medium one...This is not right.	1
I usually love Chips Ahoy products, but not these. The chocolate had a very funky aftertaste. I have to wonder if they were somehow affected by shipment, but I probably wouldn't chance buying them at the store. I usually don't have a problem with any type of cookie, but I gave these to my dad.	1
Not whole nuts but broken pieces, brownish and not white, stale, old and bitter.  Unable to eat them. The worst I ever had.	1
I thought that I should try a single pack from my local co op before buying multiples. So glad I only bought one pack. These smell horrible, like chemicals. The texture is mushy and not pleasing at all. I would never recommend these to anyone. I am going to try kelp noodles as a replacement for these.	1
I've been eating these for months and actually really enjoy them.  I just came online in order to buy some more and decided to read these one-star reviews (I couldn't believe somebody didn't like them!) -- I have eaten my very last Trio bar.  And (sarcastically) thank you very much Mrs. May!!!!	1
Kinda makes me feel like I'm eating chocolate throw-up pounded into a bar. Not tasty at all. Wish I could return.	1
This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.	1
Horrid dented cans. Do fall for this scam of dented cans.this was replacement order and cans dented rip off dont be fooled	1
All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior.	1
this product has a terrible.  the taste is awful. You only get a hint of the flavor peach.  i like it has zero sugars ,fat carbs, but does it have to taste so bad.	1
I do not recommend the Grove brand of coffee and certainly not the Cappuccino. One cannot brew even a decent Cappuccino in a Kcup brewer. It takes a real Cappuccino brewer with high pressure and steamed milk. This Capuccino lover says forget this one.	1
I should have read the nutritional information--way more sodium than my husband should have at a meal.  The packaging is bulky and it takes a long time to soften.  The small salad is supposed to serve 2.  On the plus side it does taste good.	1
Eating this stuff. The grains are hard as pebbles. The whole family here voted "Horrible". We will use for bird feed.	1
If these taste like cinnamon bars, I'm a monkey's uncle. My mother and I spit them out.Don't waste your money.	1
Absolutely no coffe taste at all.Just do make out that its chocolate.Sorry Product.There are more choices on Amazon that are much better.	1
I switched to whole milk. I tried Pure and Nido to use in my office to add to coffee and tea. Pure fits my needs, since it dissolves well in hot beverages. Nido tastes very well as well, but does not dissolve very well in hot beverages.	1
This peanut butter tastes horrible just like the choco choco chunk.  I couldn't give it away either.  No body liked it.  It went in the garbage and got refunded.	1
This would have been a nice mix if not for the guar gum. If you have anyone in the family with IBS, this will likely cause stomach cramps for a day or so - not pleasant.	1
Too hot and maybe one part of a shrimp in the entire bowl.  If it had not have been so hot the noodles would have been good.  I had to drink milk with it to cool my mouth down,	1
I love Annie's regular mac & cheese, but this version was gross.  The white mystery powder turned into a gross, gelatinous mess when I heated the product as directed with water.  The whole thing just turned my stomach and I thew it out	1
Tastes like soap.  Impossible to regulate the amount of caffeine you're ingesting - you're supposed to use a squirt, but depending on how long you squeeze, lots of the liquid can go into your drink.	1
Not sure what they were going for, a taste of Aloe or just crisp fresh water, but anyway they missed on both ends. This thing tastes horrible. I even tried giving it to my kids to try and they thought it was horrible as well. It was pulp free but just didn't taste like aloe.	1
I have had several other brands of kettle chips before, all of which are delicious and rather addicting. These chips, however, did not live up to expectations - they tasted like lightly flavored cardboard! I didn't even finish the bag, and ended up throwing it out. If you're looking for flavorful kettle chips, look elsewhere.	1
So i tried this one day and was naseuous after drinking one serving mixed with water.Maybe it was funky artificial mango pineapple taste? Or the artificial sweeteners in it? Either way it was pretty nasty.. I wouldnt drink this again nor offer to anyone.	1
I really didn't like this drink at all. There is a bitter after taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth for a long time. I tried drinking it slowly, sipping, then drinking quickly, nothing helped. I finally gave them to my husband and he drinks it some but still we have a lot left over.	1
They were old, chewey..not fresh and crunch as expected from any store. Perhaps I received an old batch however I would not order again. Stick to store brands from local farmers markets.	1
I love cinnamon but this is weak. I also do not like the taste of the combination of grains.  This does not have enough crunch for me. I wouldn't like this even over ice cream.	1
The ingredients are simple - Fruit juice, fruit puree, natural flavor, caffeine, Setvia, carbonation.but it doesn't do much or taste that great. It barely tastes like strawberry banana and didn't give me an ounce of energy.It's basically caffeinated, stevia-sweetened carbonated juice. There's not much more to say because this energy drink didn't do anything	1
These pumpkin seeds are colorful but that's about it.  Are they from China? Who knows? Are they loaded with pesticides? Who knows. Do they contain nuts? Yes. Big disappointment. Not like Amazon to allow this. We all need to band together...at least those who are concerned, and call Amazon customer service.	1
The bag was busted down the side and thrown all over the box, I put them into the trash, I am sure they would have been delicious.	1
The coffee taste very bitter and a pack is way too much for a solofil cup leaving me to measure out half a packet for each cup of coffee that I need and having to leave the packet half full for the next cup.	1
Tried this stuff.  Didn't like it, kids didn't like it, wife didn't like it.  Gnarley, nasty taste.  Waste of my money.  I do not recommend this product.	1
It's in a cardboard box, just stuffed inside.  I was told it could not be returned 'because it's a grocery item'.  Seriously?  They told me I could dispose of it.  I did try one cup, though, and it's absolutely flavorless.  It tastes like hot water.I cannot recommend this at all.	1
Extremely disappointed in these....each one tasted just like the previous piece...boring, sadly...waste of money...will never order these ever again...too bad we can't return!	1
I tried the cappuccino and was totally disappointed. Barely any coffee taste at all. Just a weird, artificial, bitter taste. It is like if you take a little bit of coffee and dump a cup of that powdered creamer in it. Nasty.	1
PIcked this up for a caramel latte drinker, thinking it would do the trick. It 100% did not cut it. The taste was way off and tasted more like fake vanilla extract than cream.	1
Not a very tasty bar. I can eat one if I have a good sixteen ounce drink to help flush it down.  They have a tendency to hang in the back of your mouth.All in all not my favorite.	1
I am not sure what this tea was made of, but it sure did not taste like tea.  It tasted like something damp and horrible, muddy and bizarre.  There was no comparing this to any teas I have previously tasted, and I am an avid tea drinker.  I will never eve purchase anything from this company again.	1
I took 1 sip and had to dump it. I regularly drink emergen-c, which is a similar powdered, fizzy vitamin drink. Maybe it's the herbs in the eboost, but it had a metallic, medicinal, bitter taste to it. Too bad it doesn't taste as good as it smells.	1
Purchased on sale and now I can see why. This is a terrible product. Contains lumps and some kups do not have any product in them. Will not reorder.	1
I spent $12.99 on this popcorn and my husband used it once.  He didn't like it and went back to his other brand.  Another bad buy from Amazon.	1
I was greatly disappointed in this stuff. They call it cookies but it hard little chips that are tasteless. Save your money and buy something else.	1
Ritz had the bright idea of taking the same faux cheddar spread used in small doses as the Ritz Bitz filling and blowing it up to adult size, adding a multi-grain sheet of styrofoam to make it "adult".If this were served on the Space Shuttle, I'd pop outside to vomit.Simply awful.	1
This tea is not sweet, at all. It's got a terrible aftertaste. I make it with lots of sugar, just like a would Lipton Tea. I won't be buying this again.	1
Horrible, Nasty taste. Off-tasting sauce, the pasta was okay, but the sauce was the worst! Nasty, just plain nasty. Don't buy this. You'll be sorry!	1
I am open to almost anything but this stuff is the worse thing I have ever tasted!!!  It is nasty and I have yet to taste any fruit flavor...just plain gross...even tried adding a bit of Stevia and that did not help...really made it worse...Rihanna can have this!!!	1
Does not mix well at all, lots of nasty sediment at bottom of cup. Bitter and burnt tasting as with most starbucks coffees. Not buying ever again.	1
My kids and husband got SOOO sick from this product!!!  Shocking it was!  This is SO not GF.  I won't touch Betty Crocker with a 10 foot pole now.	1
I love truvia so I thought I'd try Zevia....it is absolutely horrible!!! It literally tastes like soda that has way too much carbonation and not enough flavor and sweetener. I really don't know how anyone could drink this.	1
I was looking for a great organic e.v. olive oil and because all the other reviews of this product were 5 stars, I was hoping to love this but I didn't like the flavor or the sediment I could feel. Sorry Paesano :)	1
SOY... on the nuts... HORRIBLE!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! Who on earth would be stinking soy on nuts!!! NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!	1
Didn't like the taste of this at all. It has a strange taste to it. I thought I would lie it because it is thick and dark but I don't It has a strange taste that I don't care for.	1
The reason why I love chai tea is the spice! Too sweet and too low on the spice. I am shocked that adults like this. I make it homemade, East Indian style.	1
ONE STAR, because I didn't order ESPRESSO, but that's what I got.  Gave it away, and ordered coffee from Walmart.	1
Notice how they are all amazon verified purchases and ALL 5 Stars and everyone found them 100% helpful? Sounds too good to be true? Yep! There are 0 actual reviews for this product, just pointing out the obvious. Look out for these fakes all over amazon. There are lots of fakes to try to sell the product.	1
Kirkland as sams club, walmart, giant eagle clover, and many many more, do not have any trace of pollen. Yes, they remove it by ultrafiltration, and without pollen, no health benefit, NO reason to pay the price. Lets bring this fraudulent companies down, so they start caring for what they are putting on the shelves. Shame on you Costco!!!!	1
Wow, this drink not only tastes terrible, it made my heart really jittery.I can handle caffiene good enough, but this stuff was just too much for me, I'll NEVER drink this stuff again!	1
I would have loved to love these bars but I just couldn't. Everything about them sounded delicious but something was just off. I love almonds, dark chocolate, and the two together are great. Somehow these just didn't come together.	1
I did not care for this product very much. Even though I like everything pumpkin, this product did not taste good to me and had a really bad after taste. Sad.	1
I love asparagus but these were awful.  There were so many hard inedible pieces in these cans.  Disappointing for the Libby brand and price.	1
Did not like the taste of this coffee. I had a few people try it and agree....it wasn't all that good. Cheap, yes, tasty, no. Probably not the freshest, either. Won't buy again. Sorry!	1
Soy: (the soy in this product is NOT organic unlike the coconut oil in the same bottle)-In its non-organic form is a GMO known to cause infertility in the third generation of rats. The implications for humans are understandably similar.-Contains high levels of phytic acid, which strips nutrients as it passes through the large intestine.AVOID.	1
OK, in case you're wondering about all the "5-star" reviews, this company has already been caught using its employees to write product reviews to give you an idea about their ethics.Next...their stuff just tastes *bad* - but don't bother to complain because they won't refund your money in any way, shape, or form.Avoid this company's products like the plague!	1
Unless you are obsessed with natural, don't buy this product.  It tastes like oily fish.  What sesame?  Couldn't taste anything but fish.  Feeding it to my dog.  She loves it, by the way!	1
This is the most horrible thing I have every tasted. It has a sickening taste and odor to it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY...HORRIBLE!	1
now who in their right mind , that knows that the animal s***s this stuff out and then you people drink it.WTF	1
I'm a coffee drinker and have tried various brands.  The price was great for this but in the variety pack there might have been a few 'bold brew' that tasted like coffee.  The others were incredibly weak.  The flavored coffees were awful.  Would not recommend this to anyone that enjoys coffee.	1
The flavor of these is pretty nasty. I thought I was purchasing the carbonated (my mistake) that I really enjoy, but these are not the same. Don't like much at all and my son almost gagged.	1
Admittedly mea culpa here. But the listing really does not adquately convey this is decaf coffee... Needs to be much clearer (different lid, should be noted much sooner in listing.	1
Tasted like mush.  Took a while to cook, too. There are lots of good breakfast cereals available--it's not necessary to eat this tasteless stuff.  Expensive too.	1
These pouches are a no go for my daughter. She despises them and refuses to try again. Oh well---next flavor ;)	1
one of the things not recommended for no-cal or low-cal sugar replacements is to have sucralose as a major ingredient and this is one of the sugar replacement that uses sucralose	1
I bought this after trying the brownie mix which was outstanding.  The dark brown blob that is supposed to be a chocolate chip, tasted rancid and not in any way chocolate.  Utterly disgusting product.  I suffered from stomach issues later that night	1
I bought this thinking that if it even partially lived up to the hype that it would be excellent.  Nope. It popped up really nice and fluffy, looked wonderful but when we tried to eat it the kernals just flattened into unchewable bits.  We threw it away.	1
These were nasty..., to me anyway.These were just gross IMO, I'll stick to fresh or fried apples in the future.	1
Everyone in my house hated the taste of this popcorn; even my dog who loves popcorn! Im not quite sure what this product is supposed to be. Something sweet or sour...because frankly it tastes like nothing; except maybe artificial. The only thing it has going for it is that its crunchy.	1
Bitter and off putting can describe the flavors and aroma or just plain terrible! I hate this coffee!!!!! I wish I had never wasted my money on this but lesson learned.	1
I bought Idahoan potatoes at another store and thought Betty Crocker would be as good or close to as good. These are really NASTY! Too salty, awful bacon flavor bits, and no creaminess. No way will I ever buy these again. YUCK!	1
Being from India, and a samosa Lover, i was excited to find out amazon had frozen samosa. Have to say the quality was stale, the taste was bland, it smelled of old oil. Taste could use more flavor. a true indian samosa has a variety of spices for authentic flavor, this had bland mashed potato with salt. disapponted. :(	1
terrible flavor. I love pho soup and even though I have had this for about a month i have only eaten one. very disappointed.	1
This is really fake tasting and overly sweet.  The chunks inside the drink to not help either.  This is almost as bad as the Goya ones you see at the supermarket.  No recommended at all.  Try Vita Coco or Naked.	1
The only miracle is that I got suckered into buying these.  I thought they'd be a dry noodle, but they're floating in liquid (so you don't get many to a package.  They are pretty much tasteless and kind of slimy.  Sorry, but I threw most of them away.	1
If someone crapped in a sock, ran hot water through it, poured it into a cup and made it smell like coffee, it would be the exact same as these.  My staff likes one of the flavors, but for the most part they are terrible.	1
Each k-cup I try to use explode on top, the cups are not sealed good it seems like one side is more as the other and keep exploding, wasted $55 .. I never had this issue before or with any other k-cup will not order again	1
We ordered &#34;Cookies & Cream&#34; but received the dark chocolate instead. We did not care for the dark chocolate so we donated them to  a local food drive.	1
I can't really attest to the health benefits of this product, but it tastes bad.  Very very bad.  Do not buy it for that reason alone.  Pick up some vitamin water or crystal light instead.	1
6,000 pages?6,000 pages?I'm at about 800 pages and am running out of ink.Awaiting a response from the provider to see how they handle this.	1
It tastesTerrible taste burnt.  I bought this because of the biodegradable packaging  but will not purchase it again.  Nice try!	1
Werther's Original Baking Caramel, 9 Ounce. This item arrived quickly, well packaged and undamaged. My problem with it was that it was horribly stale and as a result, tasted very bad, even after cooking. It was a HUGE disappointment because I love Werther products.	1
This does not taste at all like brown sugar... I wish it did!  I am a huge fan of zero cal sweeteners but this did not seem to cut it	1
I did not like the taste of this bread. Tastes dry unless toasted and unless cream cheese or butter put on. I will never order this bread again. Tastes a little sour to me.	1
These macadamia nuts are not dry roasted! They are roasted in gmo cottonseed oil which is extremely high in omega 6 fatty acids.	1
just nasty.hamburger helper gone bland.noodles are ok;sauce mix is throw-away. too much fake cheese flavor.you'd have to dump a lot of veggies&spices to overpower that gross cheese,haha!	1
DOES NOT FIT ALL MACHINES AND IS NOT RETURNABLE .. YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH IT . THEY GRET THEIR MONEY	1
BEWARE - contains the artificial sweetener sucralose. The taste is very prevalent throughout. It also contains sugar, but might as well be completely sweetened by artificial sweetener. Very chemical aftertaste.	1
Yuk. Taste leaves a lot to be desired. They weren't chocolate - they were coconut tasting. I hate coconut. They were dry and crumbled before I could get them from the table to my mouth. Too expensive.	1
Next time, I'll just drive 1.5 miles to Kroger or Walmart, buy their product. It all tastes the same, really.	1
tried this as I was looking for a diet drink without aspertume which I have been reading is bad for you....awful taste..bitter and hard to drink..	1
the coffee is not bad but the kcups are not sealed right. caused a mess when making and also allowed the grinds to bypass the filter and go into your cup	1
I believe FDA rules require that 'peanut butter' is at least 90% peanuts.In this product, a serving is 12 grams, and 3 grams of that (25%) is sugar.  Therefore the maximum peanut content is only 75%.And I assume that is before adding water.  With the water you add, the final product would have even LESS peanuts in it.	1
One can never have enough vanilla extract. This isn't gourmet or anything, but it gets the job done and lasts forever.	2
I have gotten Bob's Red Mill products for many years and this fits in with the expectations I have from them. Good product.	2
is a favorite for me and now my kids it was a very good deal for the money and you can buy the 24 hours a day at home in your pjs	2
You cannot go wrong with this purchase.  The dried fruit is large and has great flavor.  I will buy again and again.	2
These seem to be a specialty item and aren't available in the bigger bags, but that's OK. I like them anyway. Nice jalapeno zing to them--very tasty.	2
We've used these for apples, in a few recipes, and just for a candy dessert.  They work well, taste great, and won't disappoint you.  We recommend them.	2
You've been warned.  These are really good.  Don't open a bag and sit down with it.  Just sayin'.  I love putting these in my lunch.  Annie's is a name our family trusts, and we like all their products, but this one is especially delicious.	2
The water had a good clean taste.  I like the idea that it is PH balanced.  I had my husband try it too and he said it was good water.  No aftertaste or anything.	2
Easy to mix, tastes great! Non-Celiac husband loves these!For those that need ingredient lists, go to the actual Betty Crocker site before submitting negative reviews...sheesh.	2
This is the best cinnamon I have ever used.  The flavor is really intense, and it has somewhat of a bite to it.  I ordered some for my daughter who is a chef, and now she'll use no other cinnamon.	2
I must use decaf, but have been so disappointed with many decaf coffees that just don't have enough flavor, or are bitter and strong.  This is a bold and tasy blend...will definitely reorder.	2
It's wonderful to be able to have GF instant oatmeal for breakfast now, which is something that I haven't been about to have for at least 10 years.	2
I love love love these candies. Great way to get little ones exposed to ginger sweet with a bite spicy at the end.	2
This was a lot cheaper ordering on line than going to the Whole food Stores.akes a great selser soda pop.	2
I make instant tea in a large mug, and was opening packet upon packet of splenda to sweeten it. EZ-Sweetz tastes just the same, and a few drops are much easier than opening all those packets. I think it comes out to be about the same price also.	2
Loved this product.  Great snack to travel with and to take to work.  No mess - no fuss - great for all ages	2
Of the flavored coffees I have tried Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is by far my favorite.  It has a wonderful flavor and being able to buy in a larger quanity is a definite plus.	2
I keep these around for a quick breakfast when I'm in a hurry. They look weird, but they are really tasty ans surprisingly filling.	2
You already know these are perfect!!	2
I sent this to my parents on the east coast. They have a strict diet so I needed something for both of them.  It arrived quickly and they told me how much they loved it. It was yummy and pretty and a good price. I am pleased with this and would recommend it.	2
Great coffee great price nice flavor great value will buy again works well in kerig machines no leakage no grounds in coffee	2
I look forward to my one cup a day.  I will keep on ordering this coffee.  I highly recommend it to everyone.	2
3 granddaughters and their mom almost came to blows over who got to pick first.  the youngest (kind of a bulldozer in a tiny blond sparkle dressed body) won the battle hands down.  thankfully there was enough to go around in this large bag.	2
I love sesame seeds.  I have to make my own GF bread, buns and meals.  I love to use the sesame seeds in many of my asian dishes.  The seeds make the bread taste great too.  My 5 year loves it so it must be good.	2
This ghee is smooth, nutty, and delicious. I would highly recommend it as a cooking oil. Our Indian dishes taste much more authentic when we use ghee vs butter.	2
I found these lollypops to be very tasteful and flavorful. ore than just sweet candy full of sugar. kids also loved them.	2
Great Pecans.  Very good flavor to them.  I will eat them as is and also bake some pecan pies too.	2
I love this tea. Reminds me of what real tea tasted like before I used tea bags. No more teabags for me!	2
Since I have to drink de-caf coffee, I've tried so many different brands trying to find one that tastes good and not bitter or weak.  Donut House makes the best Decaf!	2
We LOVE this stuff! It is a little too sweet for our tastes when mixed as directed. So, we brew our regular coffee and add a couple of tablespoons to it that way. ADDICTIVE! Highly recommend.	2
With the movement to simplifying my lifestyle, baking soda does so much.  I use it to clean my laundry (it really does make towels revitalized and better able to absorb wetness) to facial cleanser.  This should be in every product in every home.	2
This box was huge and will last a long time! Product was intact and not broken or crumbly. Great price and a good deal!	2
I bought this pepper because of its delayed effect.  I had a bunch of co-workers try this with me.  Everybody had a fantastic response to this hot sauce.  Be careful though, it's burns.	2
Best thing about this product is the convenient individual cups.  I have wasted so much cereal in the past because being single, the box would not get used up before it went stale.  Tastes great too!	2
This is my favorite trident flavor, I've been chewing this for years. I will likely choose this seller again in the future.	2
My son is away at school and likes these as a change from all the junk he keeps in his dorm.  I like them too once in while.  They are good pantry staple for when the cupboards run a low.	2
Needed tamarind paste... bought this tamarind paste.... used this tamarind paste... enjoyed the food i cooked with it.... success. sup	2
Great flavor and so very handy. Handy single use containers are so convenient. Will be ordering more...highly recommended for all.	2
A great fall coffee with just a hint of pumpkin flavor- I usually buy a larger pack when i can find them and blend this through fall and winter too.	2
The 2 bite size squares of crackers have a mild garlic and cheese taste. Thats perfect as I am not a big fan of cheese. And its made of whole grains. Whats not to like about it? My toddler too enjoyed these. For travings that call for crunch, these crisps will do the job with or without a dip.	2
It was a free sample with a particular purchase.  How could I complain?!?  Not too horrible as far as sugar and carb counts, but by no means acceptable on something like an Atkins diet.	2
Want great popcorn that is organic, fresh and large popping? We are addicted to this almost every evening. Really like it's flavor, taste and size. Fills your bowl , try a little organic non butter to bring out this real great taste.	2
Hubby loves these snacks and generally keep them in the freezer to keep from eating too many. If you like peanut butter how could anyone dislike peanut butter cups with all that chocolate? Yum.	2
These bars are really, really good!  There's just the right mix of cranberry.  The only drawback is they are a bit 'sticky' - so be sure to have wet wipes handy. The whole family loves them!	2
I bought it because it was a great price from Amazon.  The family loves this cereal. We got it because of the price.	2
I loved that this product is 100% coconut milk, not in a can, and nothing else added. There are 3 servings per container so I love that too	2
great product love the taste	2
Organic corn, flour, no GMOs, and makes great corn bread, has great flavor. Couple this with fresh ground whole wheat flour, coconut sugar/succanat and other typical ingredients and voila! cornbread that everyone loves, friends and family.	2
The Hansens Key Lime is quite tasty. I dont know that I can specifically tell the difference between this and other lime sodas as far as the key lime aspect goes, but the soda itself is quite tasty, not too sweet, and is an easy choice for a refreshing soda without all the HFCS's and such.	2
I like Pu Erh tea. I like to brew it loose when i am at home. However, I do prefer tea bags when i am at work. I keep a box of this stuff at work. Has the very distinct Pu erh flavor in nice and convenient tea bags.	2
Love the taste of this product so I keep reordering it because of the ease of use and great taste. High protein content, nice texture, easy open, great container, great chocolate taste, and great price for 16oz.  Try this product if you love chocolate because you won't be disappointed !!	2
Come on; it's bacon.You can't go wrong with bacon.Bacon in a bag. Bacon in a sock. It doesn't matter.Tip.........try this as a topping on sushi, along with spicy mayo.	2
I have been gluten free for almost 2 years now, and this is a product I regularly buy. Price is great as well	2
I purchased this for my wife who likes a light roast. We typically have Green Mountain Company breakfast blend but that's my favorite so I wanted to find one for my wife to have. She loves this and has cups all the time.	2
Another perfect treat from TJ's. Sweet, crunchy, savory, delicious! Wow!This and the dried pineapple, and dried coconut are a great Tri-Fecta of tasty exotic treats!	2
I like to change up my coffee I use this to make my own blend with other beans has good flavor	2
Great Product! I've already used the flour to cook an apple tart and almond-breaded chicken strips (I only cook wheat-free). This is a very tasty and fresh almond flour with a natural sweetness.	2
I prefer fresh or frozen corn but for long term storage this canned corn is great.  It has a great taste and the kernels are firm.	2
I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT TASTES GREAT IN COFFEE OR TEA AND GOES RIGHT IN LIKE SUGAR STEVIA ROCKS ON	2
This organic spelt flour is wonderful.  I used it this morning to make pancakes and they turned out light and fluffy.  We're trying to watch our gluten intake so this is a nice alternative to wheat flour - not gluten free, but lower gluten.	2
We got a huge variety pack and this was the first to go as people at home dug down to the bottom of the jar to get to the last one.  I liked having them around during holidays because they are &#34;fun-sized&#34; and I think they're just perfect.	2
These cups were the first that I tried in Pumpkin Spice, and I really liked them a lot, and so did my friends. They are great around the holidays. I would purchase them again.	2
If you are timid or shy and can't find the tea that suits you,then try sencha matcha.It never disappoints. It is the best of both worlds. Sweet,veggie,and bright.Never to strong,never over done. I love it , I love it,I love it.	2
Delicious, handy, and nutritional. I love them, my kids love them....it makes me look like a good mom when I put this in their lunches for school. &#34;Fruit AND veggies?! She MUST be a good mom!!&#34; Yes I could make these in my own dehydrator.....but who has time for that?!	2
These were great.  I thought they were excellent but it's Hersheys, what more would you expect? :)  Great Christmas present.	2
This is the best tasting peanut butter.  My favorite is to spread on graham cracker for a great snack!  Kids love it!	2
I love split pea soup with ham. This is an excellent example of it. I like to have it for breakfast.	2
I use coconut oil for cooking and every day and I like the quality of this coconut oil.  The taste is light, perfect for all kinds of cooking and baking.  I highly recommend it.	2
Item arrived on time and is perfect will be purchaseing more specially at this great price Tim Hortons usually has the best coffee and I haven't been able to find a better tasteing brew for early morning	2
Nice quality, deep dark green color.  I will order it time and again.  It's a wonderful value, a very healthy alternative to vegetable oils,	2
This was a birthday present for my son, so the recommendation is from a Starbucks lover. This was a partial gift with the coffee tubs that come from the Starbucks company. This syrup with the coffee made his mornings when he has his coffee with his ingredients.This is the same syrup he buys from Starbucks so good deal.	2
We love these bars! Healthy ingredients, gf and dairy free. Great for snacks. We keep some in the vehicle for eating while to/from sports practices and errands.	2
I love sweet tea but gave it up because of the sugar content & I don't like the aftertaste of other sweeteners.  Ideal has no aftertaste & sweetens just like sugar.  I use it in my drinks and in cooking.  5 stars definitely.	2
Nice to have these chips on here in case we need snacks for drop by company or to go with a light lunch.	2
Why eat sugar when this product tastes great without it?  This yummy product really satisfies the chocolate craving with stevia.	2
Love the coconut oil - has a good taste and texture. We have always bought Nature's Way products and have never been disappointed.	2
Love this ability to purchase a great tea without the fancy packaging.  The tea bags are still wrapped for protection and for lasting freshness, however, in my household this box never last long enough to become stale.	2
Timothy's Decaf has been one of my best  since I started to drink coffee. Not to strong, not to weak, just right for me.  Have it in the house at all times	2
Was a little skeptical at first, just because of the such high reviews. Sometime people exaggerate quite a bit? But all the reviews proved to be true! Keurig Jet Fuel K cup coffee is the best K cup coffee I have tried yet. And believe me, I tried many!	2
I really like this soup & its great for on the go... Filling & tasteful more like a tomato Gouda. Loved it with a grilled cheese!	2
Now that I'm Paleo I love using this product in so many of my recipes. Thanks for a good, very fine, product.	2
good price and i got it on subscribe and save, even though they are currently sold out for the second shipment! love that they are white chocolate as my daughter can't eat the other kind.	2
Love the fresh strong flavor of this coffee.  The Breakfast Blend is great, too.  I store the coffee in a tight fitting canister.  Every time I open it, the fresh coffee flavor wafts out.  Hmmm!  I especially like that I can cut the filters off and empty the grounds for my compost pile.	2
Very good dark chocolate pretzel chip.The pretzels are flat unlike other chocolate covered pretzels that you might order.  I also tried freezing them and they were excellent.	2
ANY product from Bob's Red Mill will be excellent.  This mix is as good as it gets.  Anyone can use it and it can be kept forever in the original packaging.  (Heavy cellophane and sealed cardboard box)  I like it, and have been cooking at home and professionally for over three decades.	2
I purchased this product based on other reviews, I find it to be as described, with a very pleasant smell. It desolves to a liquid form very quickly. this is a good product.	2
Good balance between the honey sweetness and the ginger/lemon tartness. Very natural taste, with no nasty aftertaste. Good hot or cold. Great after dinner drink.	2
I have been drinking the SF one cup French Roast, but needed to eliminate caffeine.  This tastes as good as full caff.  I wouldn't even bother trying another product!  The packaging is awesome as well, so little waste!	2
Yummy! The flavor is just great. It tastes like what it is supposed to. Even the kids loved it, which is great! Less sugar and its is heart healthy. Can't get better than that.	2
This is nice crunchy Oatmeal square with cinnamon flavor and tastes at its best if you consume with milk and some sugar. If you add strawberries or blue berries it tastes even better. If you don't add milk, it tastes more like frosted mini wheat. Overall this is a great food for breakfast and it is recommended.	2
This Cafe Escapes product is like drinking a piece of dark chocolate. It has quickly become an office favorite around here.	2
There isn't much to say about this candy. The fruit flavor was well pronounced, it wasn't overly sticky or over sweet. Just a well made treat that tasted delicious.	2
A very tasty HOT drink u can enjoy anytime - since it's caffeine free! The citrus really comes through and really perks up your mood. Recommended!	2
i eat gluten free bars everyday for lunch for the past few years....this one is delicious. i like the tart cherry flavor combined with the salty nuts. one bar keeps me full a few hours and its always a treat when i have one of these during the day. even my picky kids like them.	2
This is an excellent drink.  Perfectly balanced sweetness with a fresh sharp ginger taste.  Can't wait to try it in some mixed drinks for the holidays.	2
This is my 2nd favorite Special K cereal. I love the yogurt chunks. It has plenty of flavor and is really good. Only complaint is that depending on how many yogurt clumps you get in your bowl, it might be a tad too sweet. But generally it's fine.	2
Gluten-free and tastes great!  I can't keep these in the cabinet.  They go fast! Everyone loves them. A very nutricious treat!	2
Sooooop yummy! Just like the movies!	2
Looks nice on the counter, fits in the cupboard. Holds enough that everyone can have their favorite handy. Was a fair price and shipped quickly.	2
This is still my favorite coffee and i get the best pricing here at Amazon! It has the best flavor and doesnt need sugar added.	2
I put this o my motorcycle and wanted this one due to its small size.  Works as good as the full sized ones, better than Homelink  and remarkable range.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Makita makes good products.  I have almost of of Makita's 18v tools.  Got a 6012HD 9.6 volt drill from the late 18 that I am still using.  This 18 volt multi-tool is a great little add to my tool chest.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My husband used this to open up an Xbox controller to clean it because it was not working well.  Worked fine on taking the controller apart and putting it back together again.  He said he would have liked it if the handle would have been a little longer for more tork.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was a  perfect fit for my Petzl headlight.  I wasn't looking for anything too fancy, just a way to pack this light for storage or for travel.  no complaints.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have four cats and none of them ate this food. I ended up letting the racoons eat it at night.  All cats are different where there eating habits are concerned. But none of mine would touch it. They smelled it and walked away. It sat on the floor a week before I gave it all to the racoons.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Having the right length screw, and one that will last (stand up to weather, etc.) makes the job worth doing.  A little pricey, but not bad.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
with two dogs in a small space I love these pads.  They are finally big enough and strong enough to contain everything, easy to dispose of and the company delivers promptly.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are something quick not long-term chews.  The dogs can eat them in about five minutes or less BUT they are loved by all.  Great product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The dogs love them but I do not like the smell of them myself. It smells strange but my opinion does not matter	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Assembled in seconds.  Large and sturdy design.Only problem, my 22 lb tabby kept hurling himself against the sides to move it around the backyard.

When I first got it in, I thought how cheap it looked and that when I turn the water on I was going to have a leak, but to my surprise it didn't leak. The valve quickly turns the water on and off. I was impressed. Thanks for a fine product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This is a very well built and solid sander.The sander is very heavy and there is very little vibration(if any) so the sander will stay put and not move so there is no need to mount it to a stand or table,it will stay put where ever it is placed.It is well worth the cost and I strongly recommend it!

We really love these toys.  Our bulldogs play tug with these and they hold up to their ruff play... The two rings we purchased have held up for a long long time. Worth the the price paid for this toy. YES it is an amazingly good toy...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Purchased to replace approximately 20 year old pump that was installed by previous homeowner. This pump is amazing quiet and if plumbed correctly I can barely hear it running.

using it as illumination for a trailer license plate.  super bright.  way brighter than the similar style incandescents that have always been the norm.  im thinking about getting one or two for lighting around our 12v off grid cabin.  they would be plenty bright to light up a set of 5 or so stairs.

This is a teeny tiny kong made out of the softer rubber that my dog prefers.  It holds small treats and makes my dog work for them.  It keeps her busy a bit longer than the larger ones so I have a few on hand.  Well made, strong, puppy proof.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i lost my last one so i was glad to see it arrive. i remember when they came with the saw but those days are long gone	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

High quality dog food....and the pup's loved it with or without any moist food on top. Paper bag so check carefully for those invasive mealy bugs as they are tough to wipe out. So far so good with my orders on Amazon and dog food in paper bags. Plastic sealed food and treats are what I try to get.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I use this for all of 20 seconds when I clip my dogs nails. It used to be an easy process until my Vet quicked my guy and how he does terribly for nail trimming.

This brush does a great job lifting old dead fur. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to use it right after a giving my pug a bath but he loves getting brushed with it and man it just pulls so much off fur that then doesn't stick to us, furniture, or get into the carpet.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

We don&#8217;t have a dog, so using this motion-sensor equipped floodlight was just fine. When I was done installing it, I felt instantly more secure.

These work awesome with a himalayan salt lamp. They are very bright and get fairly warm. Mine has been on 24/7 for about a month and it's holding up well. None of them arrived damaged and they had minimal packaging.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was a great investment!  It makes giving our yorkie poo a bath SOOOOOO much easier, as she hates bath time.  We had a hard time getting her rinsed out well, but this rinses her coat out great!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have some pretty picky eats for dogs. they really seem to enjoy the Iams Sensitive Naturals. For the price, I think this is a good value, and we will continue to buy it for our two dogs.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have used several different headlamps for duck hunting. This is the best one I own. The new LED model is much better than the other older models (they were pretty good too). I recommend it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have had two or three of these because they burn out so fast. they also use batteries really fast.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our parakeet loves this kabob....being a female, she has a need to chew & shred (nesting instinct)...absolutely loves this! Keep your Keet busy & happy; ours chirps, shreds and chips again a tune of pure happiness!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I Love this product!  It does what it says.  It's a very good idea.  Whoever came up with this is awesome!  Our cat mostly used his scratch post; but also likes a couch downstairs.  This has messed with his ideas for our couch!  Ha!  Thanks!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So cute all the clothes are adorable and look good on the animals. The shirt is pretty and blue makes my boy much more handsome. He looks good in this wonderful shirt. I will purchase more for him.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this for my 52&#34; table saw and it does a great job. This read out memorizes its position even when you move the fence without turning it on. The automatic shut off comes also handy if you forget to turn it off when you're done with the saw (which would never happen to me ;) .	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I use these for cleanup for my older cat who has a problem not getting all of her waste off the backside (not to be graphic).. these work great and don't irritate her at all. Will buy again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These dog leashes work great for my two large dogs.  They are strong and dry quickly.  I have one in blue and one in black.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Their spatulas. They spread your bondo or resin. These do great and the bondo peels off when you're done for re-use.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
if you're adding a new relay, this is the perfect wiring harness for it. Originally I was going to use terminals and solder them, but this made the job so much easier. wire is good quality and connectors fit real tight for good contact	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The bed is exactly what I expected.  It fits perfect in the crate and provides enough padding for my dog	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We kept leaving our heater on at the office and potentially causing a fire.  This outlet took care of that problem.  We were going to get one of those wireless internet ones, but why spend $40 more?	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Works well and seems to be well made. I like the fact it is not hanging off the front of my dash in the power socket	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My Boxer is a chewer and I'm very piticular about the rawhide chews I buy him. I definitely don't want anything from China or Mexico and its hard to find many good ones from the USA, especially thin chips like these.  I'm quite impressed, and he's one happy pup!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These things are amazing - so far have used them extensively have them bolted to the top of my tool case to hold down flat stock for cutting - when clamped down they do not move at all - at the price would recommend to everyone..	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I was happy to get a good piece of equipment, seems to be well made....fit the chuck and all seems in order, only tested, will put into full use in a few days....	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
forget those expensive electronic stud finder....this is all you need.  No studs can hide from you.  The bubble leveler can be rotated.  buy this and donate your more expensive stud finders to goodwill.  you will not regret.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Awesome too to have around. It cuts to a 14 gauge galvanize wire so I decided to buy it. It does what is suppose to do. Happy that I did. Recommended for the price.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The product arrived on time in a nice re-sealable package.  This is the first food of this type my dogs will eat.  I feed raw and like to occassionally add some veggies.  With Grandma Lucy's, I can skip the processing and purchasing.  It is ready in a flash.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
great to use with the pump on my 75 gallon tank.  helps to keep the water clear, I have some goldfish and they can be messy..good value for the price	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have been using this product for over 15 years now and I still love it.  I am in the animal field and have many animals and this seems to work the best on carpet, cement, etc.  Gets the smell out and even helps prevent remarking.  Easy to use.  Great product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I should have got this a long time ago=this doggie car seat is perfect for my two little dogs=there are two clips to attach to my little babies to keep them strapped in=nice to roll down the window knowing that the babies are secure	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Good food for my bunny. His coat is shiny and he is a healthy weight. He loves to pick the carrots out first!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have tried to buy these at the Big Box stores, with no success.  This CFL model is MUCH more compact than others, which makes it fit much better in lamps.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These last longer than the ones you buy in the store - the size is great so I don't have to purchase the treats so often.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are high quality and my dogs (chihuahuas) love them! I stuff them in a Griggles soft hide a treat toy and they spend awhile chewing them out. Delicious and nutritious.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Very strong, well made chisel.  I have not had it long enough to observe the claimed self-sharpening action.  Works for all SDS plus rotary hammer drills with hammer-only settings.  Not for the DeWalt DC212 or Hilti TE-17 drills which always rotate.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Too bad! ours was defective, needle totally unresponsive. Since it was fulfilled by Amazon they are paying return postage. Thank you for that.Oh well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Joey our Lakeland Terrier loves them, he gets one every night at bedtime, we got the first packet from the Vet, until I found them on Amazon cheaper, you can get 1 or 2 big ones in the packet, I just cut them in half, so a very happy puppy and happy customer	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Looks exactly like OEM and fits exactly like OEM. The price is almost unbeatable. From what I hear FRAM is one of the OEM's for the 2010+ Mazda3, so I went off internet rumors and bought one of these.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Love these, work great under pee-pee pads, under crates, on furniture to protect it. I have several of them, they are easily washed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Scissors are very durable and sharp.  This is a must have tool when grooming around the ears and eyes.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My Cats go crazy for this thing.  They LOVE it.  I put it away after use as I am afraid that they could hurt themselves on the wire if I were to let them play with it unsupervised.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Most of the seeds in this mix my birds love, some of the bigger ones, they cannot get into.  Overall, great stuff.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I made some drawers for a cabinet and had to make slight adjustments to get the sliding drawer slides to work. Making wood shims is a pain or can even be dangerous. These shims worked perfectly and are fantastic.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is my second Chamberlain door opener. They both work very well and were easy to install. This one even pulled up the door after it had frozen to the concrete after a thaw and then a freeze. Wisconsin.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These work well for clipping mats out of cats and dogs. Be very careful when clipping mats from a Persian--their skin is very thin.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Just as the title says...this HP17TAC is awesome...is my Mag replacement.The focusable beam is incredible! there are no &#34;rings&#34; created like a mag when zooming the beam in and out.  The beam produced is very bright but completely concentric.  The beam when focused is a tack sharp.Highly recommend; great machine work, high quality.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
When transitioning our cats to an all wet species appropriate diet, I crushed a tablet and sprinkled it on top of the new wet food.  It is apparently delicious enough to entice kibble addicts to give wet food a try.  :)BTW Hairballs are a non-issue, now that none are fed kibble.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great for a chihuahua or wienie dog or maybe a lil bigger but not really for larger dogs  Its sturdy enough but steps are a lil small for a larger dog. I guess they could learn though but this is plastic so I wouldnt let a fat st bernard go up it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Have not try the cables yet. Cables are thick and long, and unlike those cheap plastic clamps, these are insulated metal clamps. Cables core are thick.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
nice assortment for the hobbyist.  packed in a hard plastic case.  A good item to include in a new purchase, or to add if you're giving a saw as a gift.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I took a chance and bought these to string along the hedge located about 25' from my patio door...they show up nicely at night but don't last more than 3-4 hours.  Still they are pretty while they last.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I trust Hikari fish food..I was surprised to read the label of this tubifex product, and see it comes from China not Japan.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My Labs each received one of these from Santa and are still working on them. They do not smell, like lets says cow's hooves, and it keeps them busy. I would buy again from this seller. Thanks!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Easy to install, looks very nice, & heavy duty. High quality lock that should last a long time. I did a lot of research & read several Amazon reviews and am very pleased with this choice. The lever is easy to change from left- to right- handed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The material looks to be of high quality.  Definitely comfy - for humans too... while it's clean anyway.  My dog likes it certainly.  Probably the only surprise was the thickness.  It's about 5 or 6 inches.  I expected the width to be a bit more but it's not a problem because the cushion is legit.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This product is of great quality. I like the fact that the bottle doesn't contain plastic and the fish oil comes from pure waters of Iceland. My dogs love the taste. Their hair looks very nice.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
As the need for eye protection is very important, I canot say enough about saftey glasses and these are nice!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I have two rabbits who are not jumpers. This suits them perfectly! The divider is great providing a nap/potty area from the play area. Even my kitten loves to be in it! Super easy to put together and clean! I will be buying another!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is great not only because it's not made of glass, but because when I need to remove it to give the my turtle tank a thorough cleaning, it's not hot to the touch.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is only thing my puppy can not tear apart and keeps her busy trying to get all the goodies out.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It did nothing that the product claimed. I ve got 4 cats and not even one of them looked intersted in the catnip. More than that they seem to dislike the smell of it as they just step back quick after they smell it. Waste of money , will ask for money back	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Followed the directions supplied, and it worked with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus with my VW EOS.Had a few codes set, was able to show the dealer what I had for codes. Of coarse they still charged me the norm $50 for diagnosing, but I knew that with the code set I could continue to drive without damage to the vehicle.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our lArgentina dog is a white english bulldog, who loves Waggin Train treats. Her favorite is the smoky chicken jerky and these come a close second. I like these because they also have sweet potatoes which is healthy for her, so we buy both.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
