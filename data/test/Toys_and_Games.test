They made the holes BIGGER. There is no challenge to this game. You can get out every piece easily.  The winner is determined by whoever goes first.  The only way you are going to make that buzzer go off is if you play blindfolded.	1
My daughter is 5 and loves this scooter.  However, it lasted maybe three weeks and broke.  Now it is living in two pieces in the garage.	1
Not keeping.  Love my daughter too much to give this to grandchild. LOUD, noise sings itself.  ANNOYING does not begin to describe it.  Mama nixed this.  Returned.	1
This was NOT the Easy-Bake oven that I had when I was a kid.  Pans kept getting stuck, fingers kept getting burned, and kids kept getting bored.  Real disappointing.	1
My son does not like this toy for the amount of money paid I would not recommend it. It is very boring and the balls never fall into place you just end up chasing the balls so they don't get lost.	1
The batteries always fail after between 1 and 20 flights.  Usually, they fail before 10 flights.  You'll spend a fortune buying replacements.	1
You can simply buy a simple chain necklace from Dollar Tree for $1. It's less material, but it's durable none the less.	1
I did not like the way this doll looks at all.  I checked them out at Walmart after I received this one and they are all misshapen in my opinion.  It is certainly not the sellers fault, rather the designers fault in the way this doll is put together.	1
This is way too small for my leappad I don't don't know what leap pad it's supposed to be for, but they picture one that looks like mine.  After reading all the reviews about it making the touch screen not work I guess I'll count my blessings I didn't put it on.	1
TOTAL CHINESE JUNK..SHOULD HAVE NEVER ORDERED FROM CHINA...NONE OF THE ITEMS I ORDERED WERE NICE AND HALF OF THEM I DIDNT EVEN GET...AND I REALIZE THEY ARE CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP AND SO I WAS NOT EXPECTING FINE JEWELS BUT I WAS EXPECTING THINGS TO ARRIVE IN ONE PIECE.	1
I read the specs that says it can make up to 12 cars at one time. BUT, that is if u have lots of other lego bricks! these are not able to build even a single complete car. What a waste of money.	1
These balls are not what I thought.  They are extremely small and don't glow.  A waste of money, I was planning to use these as mardi gras throws.. very dissapointed	1
I was very disappointed that this doll would not speak. I bought the movie also because of the reviews. So I cannot truly rate them	1
Bought two of these.  One is still working other only shoots a foot after two days of use.  Poor quality.	1
Just like most items like this it's junkKids oaky with it for one day and all the pieces fall off and disappearComplete junk not recommended but it's hard to say no to your child	1
Huge disappointment - flimsy design. Cars didnt stay charged. Sent it back. Dont waste your money. Very disappointed little boy.	1
Flimsy little pen.  Just bought to add to my daughters collection of Monster High dolls.	1
There is no way this thing is worth $6 just to hang 5 cars on the wall.  Save your money or just buy your kid 6 cars which they will enjoy much more.  This thing doesn't even stay on the wall.	1
died after 2 uses.  Very disappointed in the life of the battery.  Now I know why they are so cheap.	1
My son only used the vehicles to access the gaming options on our tablet.  The track has never been touched.	1
As soon as I got this for my daughter (For her birthday) the pendent fell off... she was very upset... money wasted!!!	1
Some key components were missing and I didn't open it on time so now I'm stuck with a game I can't play.	1
Adorable... But... The zipper broke after first use... One full unzip and the zipper was done. It fell completely off of the teeth, you can put it back on, but, it wont stay on. I didnt return, because I ordered it earlier than when it was given as a gift. Disappointed.	1
I bought this as a spare.  First time out, after it binded, it took off and kept going until I lost sight of it.  Would not respond to the transmitter.	1
I had to tried several times to get a bubble to form in the  wand. The wand doesn't form the bubble that well.	1
The camera did not come complete to operate and the display online indicated that it was ready to be used.	1
This is cheap crap that breaks all the time. Also didn't even get the clips I was promised.  I say it's overpriced junk	1
not happy with purchase- over 1/3 of pearls were defective- I didn't expect much but when they were not even nice enough to wear... whats the point. I bought them for a special event and because of the defects I didn't have enough for everyone. very disappointing.If you use this vendor- definitely buy way more than you need.	1
These were not that great... I was completely unimpressed. They STUNK when we got them (no fault of Amazon).... like a defunct plastic factory. They are just giant foam fists... pass!	1
Does not work.  Had to return it.  Also purchased one for another child as a gift--stopped working also.	1
Too slowSon gets frustrated and loses interest.Look online for other options.not happy with many cartridges sold.pricey too.	1
This toy is junk, Do not buy this toy.  It broke on the initial use and I bought two of them.  The second one broke on initial use as well in the bath tub.  Good idea for a toy, but ours was junk.	1
ok this doesn't really swim but just kind of bob up and down awkwardly. we tried all sorts of batteries and it still always operated like the batteries were almost dead...doll would hardly move at all. my daughter just played with it like a barbie doll...and was very disappointed there was no magic about it	1
so 1/3 of the bands are pink and purple, making this batch useless for our BOYS' birthday party which will have only one girl in attendance. (While I think it's just fine for boys to wear pink and purple, most boys don't seem to care for it!) BUMMER.	1
my kids love these, so i went and bought the HUGE pack of 40 pieces. after waiting forever for them to get here (which was fine, i knew they were coming from China), less than half of them actually work..crappy product and i wouldnt recommend wasting your money on something that doesnt work when you receive it...	1
Like other reviews I to found that this gun will jam and cut heads of rounds off, to bad that nerf is in sushi a hurry to release new products. they should do more development before release of new stuff.	1
Children had a hard time with potato body particularly the storage part. Very frustrating for young children. One almost two year old got small piece caught in throat; rescued by mother and child okay but toy was taken away. Seemed to hold the interest of 4-5 year olds but not younger or older kids.	1
My whole family loves the Angry Bird games on iPad, so we bought this. After about 10 minutes you have done all you can with it. Really boring.	1
this is cheap, flimsy and bad quality! It is NOT what it looks like. it also never stays up!!! Even my toddler son didn't like it and never played inside (and he's a BIG Jake fan) If my husband didnt toss it in the trash, I would've returned it. Waste of money.	1
Don't waste your money on these. They come three in a pack and I thought they would make cute stocking stuffers for my three grandkids. Two of them arrived broken, and the vendor never responded to my email.	1
This was bought for my 1 year old son who has a reverence for cars already. This toy broke within 5 minutes..we thought maybe the batteries died..nope. My MIL paid WAY to much for this poorly made toy.	1
Skip this one for sure.  The blue "gel" side does not work! As soon as you make a second mark or line in the gel the original mark disappears. So you pay $10 to draw one line or circle!	1
Did not like the bands. Some were fat and some were thing there was not consistey in the size of the bands.	1
It was an awesome gift for my 7 year old step daughter until about 3 weeks later when the lights stayed on, would not change color and finally ran the battery dead.  I'm very disappointed because this, in my opinion, was not a cheap gift.	1
It fell apart the first time it was opened by the child and could not be repaired.  A peiced of junkfor sure.	1
This helicopter is extremely flimsy and hard to control, instead take a look at any of the Syma S107's those are much nicer and a better value.	1
I bought these prank roach's for a joke to friends and family members. Yes, they were cheap, but I was hoping they looked somewhat real. They look like a splash of plastic with no shape at all. They are not worth the return back to seller. Oh well, this is my first negative order from Amazon.	1
I really love monster high dolls - and I love gloom beach Jackson and Basic Jackson but this Jackson I don't like.  His hair is just weird looking and his pants are just way too skinny and he looks like he is sick or something.  Just disappointed on how he looks	1
The little pets that you buy for this are very cute, and my daughter likes to collect them.  I bought this play set to go with them, but it is so simple and I don't think she has ever played with it.	1
According to this report, several Playskool products including Tinkertoys contained phthalates when tested: [...] and [...]Phthalates are toxic chemicals that can be absorbed through skin contact and are commonly found in plastics. They are used to make plastics soft and flexible. Get the wooden ones made by Schylling.Makit Toy - 70Pcs.	1
O ordered this and when I received it I wasn't happy it is a fake and it will not interlock with the real rainbow.  I did return it and no problems getting a refund.  This loom is ok if it's the only one you have but you can not connect it to the authentic rainbow loom.	1
My daughter received this for her 5th bday from her Aunt. She loved it and played with it every day. Less than a week after receiving it, it won't shoot water anymore. It was not dropped at all. What a disappointment.	1
This thing didnt make it 5 min. The claw is a non functional piece of junk.Dont waste your money.	1
This was garbage before we broke each cardboard piece from the punch out. They bend while your trying to get them out and eventually snap or peel.	1
Horrible 10 gillion pieces	1
Although these are cute, they won't even stick to paper. You will have to glue them on. Don't waste your  $$$$$$$!	1
I got this doll in good timing however, the only bad thing was that the dolls hair was purple. According to the description it should have been pink. That was a terrible experience. And after I returned and reorder same story.	1
The wings, the only reason to get this barbie, are terrible.  they fall off, they don't stay open.  we returned it to target and saw a mini pile of similar returns there.  we had some tears over the crap product.	1
Get ready for a work out!!!! You will pump you butt off to get this thing to work...was very dissapointed about how labor intensive it was. Plus I bought from an Amazon scalper. Wal-mart thru Amazon had them for half the price and this guy bought them out and doubled the price.	1
The roll pin comes off each time i move it around or try to roll back paper or something....poor quality, on my list of returns.	1
I gave my honest opinion of this tiny truck earlier and was roundly verbally attacked for my words.  Our little one likes it.	1
The stickers pealed off within one day. Very cheap and was never used by my kids. I would not recommend.	1
These bands do not compare to the genuine rainbow loom products. My son tried making the more complex bracelets that he know how to make and they kept on braking and the colors in person are a little weird.	1
The doll wasn't very well made, so we returned it.  Really nothing to it and she was kind of ugly.	1
Maybe I  received a bunk one but the pen was more like a paintbrush then an aqua doodle pen it will not  teach my son how to write better at all	1
These smell like oil. I thought it would be a good deal but not worth it. Buy a different brand.	1
I bought this for my children at the thought that it would be cool to have dry erase crayons. I thought wrong i like the board itself but the crayons are hard to simply wipe off the board my children became easily frustrated with this product.	1
This has to be the worse transformer ever. It really does nothing at all but drops the blaster thing. My four year old had it broke in 24 hours.	1
This product was purchased as one of my 2 yr olds birthday presents. She tried to use it once and has not used it since. I t is small, the crayon barely fits in the pad. I do not suggest it at any age.	1
I tried several of these and they don't work. I&#34;m so glad I didn't count on these for goody bags for my sons birthday- dud	1
For some reason the grandkids could nevere get this to fly correctly and thought it was a waste of money.	1
These are so chinsey. Not worth the money at all! Do not recommend as barbie's clothes fall off them too.	1
Didn't work well. Bought two. Too much effort required to make these work and the instructions are poor. Tried various light sources without success.	1
These finger puppets are cute but my 3 year old son can't even get them on his little fingers. Kind of a waste of money for me.	1
I didn't heed other reviews because it seemed like such a good deal. The wheels broke off one plane the first time my 4 yr old played with them. A week later, 4/6 have broken wheels and one more has a broken propeller.Pay more for a better made product.	1
the colors are not vivid. Even 4 tablets in a large bath do not create a bright vivid color. The crayola tablets are far better. Also, take note, they say "300 TABLETS"- the vast majority of those tablets are TINY. There are only 100 of the normal sized ones. It's deceptive.	1
When investors don't touch something there's a reason. No fabric pieces. Fake ratings. Probably paid people to rate the product.	1
Out of the 12 pieces in the box, only 5 of them worked. Emails to the seller have gone unanswered. While the price is low, it's not low enough if you get less than 1/2 of them working.  If you order this set, be prepared for many of them to arrive defective.	1
The motor didn't  last 10 flights I wouldn't buy this motor again. it is a waist of money.I bought  a ( Modified 380X Brushed Motor) (EHB005) from Xtreme Production .I have heard good things about the Xtreme motor.	1
The dresses look better in the picture.  The detail is only on the front. Cheaply made but good for play my daughter didn't seem to care	1
I don't get it, big wheels on arms? Loooks like an Ape! ROTF version OP is far better than this ape. If you are a really serious fan of Optimus Prime, do not buy it. I mean it. This is not Optimus Prime. Save your money and buy the ROTF version before its price climbs too high	1
The velcro came off almost immedialty when my 3 year first &#34;cut&#34; the peach. The bannana velcro came off when first seperated. I wouldn't spend my money on this again, I will be spending the extra money and getting the wooden set.	1
This game is coming to ps4, so i would wait. Plus it is horrible on xbox. I heard it runs great on PC and PS4.	1
Two pegs broke before she could even use it, no instructions for ideas.  A child new to it could use ideas on what to do....the loom is also to narrow to do a lot of things we found on u-tube...	1
These little monster trucks fell apart the second I took them out of the package.  I realize they were for a really cheap price so I wasn't expecting quality but I DID expect the kids to at least get SOME use out of them.	1
The helicopter and spear parts came in a Styrofoam box that looked like it was taken out of the garbage and wrapped with shipping tape, the helicopter did not even fit and parts were rattling in side of the box around, the spear part bas had a hole in it and the small parts were missing.	1
The ninjas I received are not the ones pictured here.  They were pastel colored, smaller and not as cool as what is shown.  Don't be fooled.	1
I find these too hard to open and my son is always asking for help to open them. He is 5 y.o. and should be able to open by himself by it is just too hard even for myself. I would not buy it again.	1
A good idea to teach girls about math and engineering, but  avery cheaply made product. Why can't we just make unisex toys -primary colors and market to all children.	1
my son put this together the first day he got it. & hasn't touched it since. waste of money. & if you don't keep the instructions then you can't ever put it back together.	1
Yes, it looks great but it is really no fun at all.  As everyone has mentioned the top of the Millennium Falcon constantly falls off, there is almost no storage inside for the characters (despite it having a handle and looking like a carrying case), and it is just poor quality construction.  Too bad, because it looked great....	1
Not a great product. Certainly could not hold up to the &#34;dunking&#34; seen in the picture. Also doesn't lay flat against the door. I am concerned it will scratch it too. Not a great buy	1
Cheap and I did not plan to let my toddler show up at school with it.  Paid for logo, of course	1
Very disappointed with this bracelet maker. Between 2 adults and 2 kids, could not figure out how to make the bracelets. Would not recomend this to anyone.	1
I just spent 45 mins putting the cart together and the wheels don't go round !There is no boxed play food with this item.I have only one word to describe this and that is 'trash' !	1
had sharp edges.  not safe for a young toddler.  also made very cheaply.  had to return it.  didn't feel safe letting my 2 year old daughter or 3 year old son play with it.	1
These are very flimsy and cheaply made.  They are also quite small and do not stretch. If your child wears and 8 or higher, do not buy.	1
WHY ARE YOU PAYING SO MUCH FOR THIS TOY, ARE YOU PEOPLE CRAZY?, AT TOYS R US IS ONLY $17. ... YOU'RE GETTING RIPOFF.	1
This thing doesn't work well and is constantly falling apart. Not happy with this product at all. Had to return it. It jams really easily as well.	1
I mean really. I can't believe anyone would actually manufacture this toy. What a piece (or pieces) of crap. I mean get a real dog. Life is plastic enough.	1
After the movie MU came out my kids were very excited to play this.  Great game and fun to play!	2
I purchased these and other such items to fill Jewelry boxes I made for my 3 Granddaughters. I was amazed that they were not obviously fake pearls and at such a low price. They are well made also. I recommend these for anyone.	2
I bought this as a gift for a picky little lady. She loved it and and now wants to change the skins to match her clothes, lol.	2
I bought all the turtles for my grandson. He loves them they are very well made.I now must see about purchasing the bad guys	2
How cool is it to ride your suitcase? It is just fun to go and it makes traveling exciting.  I just love Melissa & Doug's products, they are well made and fun. Jesus' Blessings and Peace	2
If you love Kirby then you need to get this plush. It's feet are sturdy so that it stands up. Can't beat the price it is awesome.	2
The Monster Fighters Lego series is the newest obsession for our 8 year old. This made a cute stocking stuffer to go with his bigger sets from Santa.	2
My little lego lover likes the burning recycle bin :)  Nice little set for the price. Perfect for an Easter basket or stocking stuffer.	2
i love my MLP:FiM figure!! its heavy, great quality, amazing detail. looks great on my computer desk next to Rainbow Dash. i would highly reccomend for any MLP fan (brony/pegasister)	2
Schleich's reputation means quality. These figurines will be heirlooms with my grandsons. When I buy these as gifts, they are a hit.	2
Got all twelve for my grandson so he could hang the planets in his bedroom. He enjoyed putting the sets together and then stored them in ziploc containers so we could hang the planets from his bedroom ceiling,  He is a Star Wars buff!	2
I hated to pay this much for a skirt I could make, but I was realistic about what I could accomplish during the holidays.  Well, I'm glad I bought it!  It's super cute and it really made our elf look girly.	2
My daughters love these dolls, they can't stop plating and asking for more of them. this one was nice aqnds they loved it	2
But again -- this is a Christmas gift and so it hasn't been used by the children in question yet.	2
Never needs sharpened. The "lead" flows easily and consistently. It erases well and without residue just like a pencil, except it never needs sharpened. A little expensive for a pencil, but it has lasted me many weeks. I'd have gone through several wooden ones by now.	2
Purchased this system for my 4 year old niece.  It keeps her occupied for hours!!!  Battery life is not the greatest but we alos bought the wall charger and she can play it while it is plugged in which she does not mind.  Great system.	2
Grandson is going to love this for Christmas.  Box looks a little small, but quite a lot of fun and imagination inside the box.  Also is receiving another lego too, so small box will work out.  Need to buy some more SpongeBob legos to go with it too for more imaginative play!  Great gift.	2
Legos are great, just be careful as they do have small, small pieces so I don't recommend for under 4 years unless parent directly supervises.	2
This was a gift for my sister. She loves it. She takes hilarious photos of it. It's an addictive toy.	2
Kids excited to figure out what the dots were.  Guessing even before they started doing them.  Had to enlarge them as some of the numbers were hard to read.  How about one, or two, or three, for the holidays?	2
My 4 year old LOVES this toy. He plays with it often. I love that it folds up for easy storage.	2
If you're a die-hard HP fan this game is a must have. It covers all 8 films and it's so fun to see them all put together in one game like this.	2
Very popular also many of the girls love to share what they have made.nice box can store rubber bands and loom maker. Give them a craft to make on cold snowy days..	2
I bought this for my nephew. I believe he enjoyed it. Haha. I bought it wanting one for myself! Seems very cool and educational!	2
This is a really great puzzle & my 3yr old daughter loves it. It is not the puzzle pictured, it is Mickey & Minnie sitting by a campfire, which I like better! The pieces are sturdy and big, its easy for my daughter to assemble.	2
My almost 3 year olds really enjoy this. One stays on one side and the other twin stays on the other and they play together pretty nicely with this.	2
I bought this for my daughter when she was only 9 months old, and she doesn't full appreciate the toy yet - but its safe enough for an infant, it keeps her entertained with the singing that Abby does and overall a well built, great value toy that my daughter will use for a long time!	2
This set is surprisingly nice for the price I paid. My niece loved it for her 3rd birthday. I think the wand is the perfect finishing touch.	2
Who can resist getting another expansion from the Munchkin series? I love the Munchkin games and this one doesn't fail to deliver. I love that they can be used with other sets.	2
All of the Harry Potter fans had a great time playing this version.  Questions and clips cover casual to devoted followers.	2
My 7 yr old purchased this with her birthday money.  She is really getting into Legos and all the wonderful things you can build.  Would love to see more Tangled Legos be added.	2
Very cool soft Sulley, my 2 year old LOVES this thing. She also got the Mike plush toy and they seem to be in good scale to one another.	2
I bought this for christmas and my 2 year old thinks he is a big boy with his tools. It holds up well too!	2
This is so fun. i wish I could have a room full of these helicopters. Best 4ch to learn on!	2
The new focus ability, as well as the Fantastic Four roster, Silver Surfer and enemies make this a MUST have addition for anyone playing Legendary.One word of caution: Watch out for Galactus.  He's an absolute animal! :o)	2
Gave as a gift to my nephew and it was apparently a great hit for Christmas. He liked adding to his Lego collection.	2
I got one for my nephew and then went back on to get one for my Baby, too. I love this little bird.	2
My 2 1/2 year old daughter loved the dollhouse when received as a Christmas present. I expect it will provide many hours and years of enjoyment. I especially liked that many of the rooms were already furnished as well as all the holiday decorations. No battling for furniture sets in toy stores or surfing online. Easy peasy.	2
We loved to play Lego by the whole family - perfect quality, great gameplay. And very educational. Would recommend to all parents :)	2
Oh yes this is another M-D product that I have bought. We are going to have hours of fun with this and all the other products from M-D. I do know we will have to watch and not drop the cones on her little toe's. They are solid wood. Looks so real.	2
I felt a little uneasy about spending so much on a game system for my toddler. However, my niece brought hers over while visiting & my son loved it. He is now having a blast with his very own.	2
These hand painted letters are super cute.  The magnets are not super strong, but they do the job and they don't slide down or fall off.  I'm really glad I took a chance on ordering them.	2
Finally another guy monster high doll. Although he is the only guy I had previously as well since I got him in the cleo combo, but I love his look.	2
My daughter got this for a birthday surprise.  These two dolls are cute together.  My daughter loves to shop and so do these ghouls.  It comes with their shopping bags and the new shoes they bought.  Loving it!!! My daughter loves the purses they come with as well. This is a great combo.	2
Fit daughter's American Girl doll well. She loved them. These are a great accessory for AG dolls for the price.	2
very cute, great deal, came very quickly, lil girl will love it! was happy with my purchase and can't wait to give it to her.	2
The bracelets look very nice if you use one of these charms, my 8 years old dauthter is really happy to use them	2
My son is a Legomaniac.  We bought him this set as a birthday present and he loves it.  He wishes only that it had Thorin in it, but we will purchase another set for him that has Thorin.	2
This is a very nice Mystery Van any collection of either Hot Wheels or Scooby-Doo memorabilia. The color and detail are perfect.	2
Good to see my son focus for hours on something! Good set. Fun to play with afterward as holds together better than some of his other builds.	2
Started to buy up choo choos for a toddlers collection to play with while watching thomas the train. she loves it and pushing the talk button. this one has a little light the illuminates too	2
We read our daughter books every night and these make it easy and she can read them on her own if she wants.	2
This is a great kit! My granddaughter received this as a Christmas gift. She can't wait to start making all the fairies, etc.	2
A great bundle of items to use with the Leap Frog system Has many different games and stylus and every thiing to make this the toy for your little one.	2
My 3, 5 yr old boys LOVE this.  Though their favorite is Heatwave Rescue Bot.	2
If you love MH Dolls, the classroom dolls are cute and the extras are really detailed.  The locker comes with stickers to decorate and each has a journal regarding the class they are attending.  Frankie is our favorite classroom doll and her mini Watzit is too adorable. Enjoy!	2
My granddaughter loved this outfit. It made her very happy and she shares this outfit between her dolls. good buy	2
My grandson loves this dream light; it was a replacement for a different one that had just worn out with use and love.	2
So, this was for my daughter at Yule.Over all her other toys, this was the ONE she screamed about.Theyre really cute, and for the most part, really sturdy.  My only problem is Peri looses her shoes kind of easily.Great buy!	2
my daughter loves this game we played it for hours and she has also played with friends they all enjoyed it from the girls to the boys. wld recommend for elf on the shelf fans.	2
Bought this for my older teenage son. He likes to ambush his friends. He reports they have a lot of power and they have a lot of fun with them. I would buy these again.	2
This is an extremely handsome Superman. Very well made, not to fall apart like others.  My 4 & 6yr old love it and so do I!	2
Wow, what a great deal.  These dresses are adorable.  Considering the price I have no complaints.  Thank you very much!	2
Overall a great product!! We've taken it camping and used it as a night light. Durable. IF your looking for a lantern like a flashlight, then you might want look at another lantern. This is more for like reading a book and sitting in one spot.	2
Bought for 3-yr old nephew and he loved it.  He enjoyed playing with it right out of the package and it entertained him and his older brothers.	2
The item arrived on time and it is as good as it is advertised. My granson enjoys playing with it and I am very happy with the product. I highly recommend this item.	2
Very durable. My daughter loves this toy. Its been through a lot and is still all together. Definite recommend to buy!	2
My little girls enjoy puzzles like this and it seems to help them develop skills.  This one captured their imagination immediately and they set about to putting it together.  The level of difficulty is not high at all with only 24 pieces.	2
Wonderful! Well constructed. Fits in Ryan and Ryan dollhouse. Will be well worth the investment. Dish ware and other accessories are very very tiny. Not suitable for children 3 and under.	2
I love co-op games and Pandemic (along with this expansion) are my favorites! You don't have to be a lab geek to play, but it will certainly tickle your geeky science side. My boyfriend who hates science also loves the game. It's a great partner play strategy game.	2
This spider is very nice sculpted and detail I recommend to any spider girl fan and any collector.. She also comes with the gobling torso.	2
We love the Lego sets.  The Friends sets are a favorite with my granddaughter.  This particular set has so many intricate extras for all the rooms in the house.  The kids play with these sets every day.  Great product.  Lego just keeps getting better and better.	2
My niece lost a doll in this character, she searched all afternoon hoping to find her. No luck, unfortunately! I didn't see her expression or excitement for this doll, but her father (my brother) told me she loved her!	2
We got this for Christmas for dad from our children and our 5 yr old and 6.5 yr old absolutely LOVE playing it... as do mom and dad! I only wish there was an option for more than 4 players as we have two younger children (3 and 1.5) who will, eventually, want to play as well!	2
I got this for a neighbor that could not find it at any of the stores here. Her son absolutely had to have one for Christmas. It was a great hit.	2
This is a hard game to master!  but it keeps my 11 year old occupied for long periods of time so it's a hit so far.  It was a Christmas gift.  arrived in a timely manner as advertised and well packaged.	2
I purchased purchased these because the helicopter only comes with one of them and I felt that two would be make it more stable	2
My grandson adores Elmo and LOVES this guitar!  It's just the right size for a 2 or 3 year old and I expect he will get many hours of play with it!	2
This balloon is the same size as my 3 year old niece but she loves it. It is good quality and has lasted for a week now. Definitely well made.	2
I ordered this item after having received and enjoyed one of their 500 piece puzzles with a similar theme. This is another great puzzle. It shows the same excellent standards of craftsmanship and has a fun picture. While not quite as large as I had before, it still provides an enjoyable puzzle-solving experience. I would definitely get another of these.	2
Great details, fun to build. Especially in time of the Lego movie release. Wish i had one when i was growing up.	2
Who doesn't think that Legos are the greatest toy ever made? My bigger girls love regular legos and my little ones love these. Actually, because they can go together, the Duplo probably get used almost as much by my older girls as well. Super durable and fun.	2
I got a bunch of these flashlights to give our to children at my kids' birthday party. The flashlights were a hit!Surprisingly durable, very bright and easy to operate even for toddlers. My kids still play with them weeks later.	2
we got this for a Christmas present for one of our sons. when we opened the box we were surprised how good this toy looks. this is a big toy and for the price it's a winner	2
My son loves this dinosaur, although the T-Rex's always seem to eat him... Very cool would recommend. If your kids love dinosaurs, this is a very cool one.	2
I ordered this nesting doll for my kids as a stocking stuffer.  The owls are made of wood and nicely painted.  However, some of the dolls are painted shut so you really need to pull the first time. The owls are well packaged and received in a timely manner.	2
I didn't take it out of the package.  It's sitting next to the collectors edition from the ACIII video game.  It looks like it's a well made piece, but as I haven't handled it, I don't actually know.  The package is strong though.	2
This one hasn't made it into the toy box yet. My husband is having too much fun playing with it. This is a very detailed mini figure. Just adorable.	2
This game is what it would look like if Apples to Apples had a baby with South Park. Definitely not for the easily-offended, minorities, children, physically or mentally handicapable, small pets, the poor, foreigners, etc. Everyone else will thoroughly enjoy it. Raucous humor abounds.	2
My three year old loves playing with this in and out of water! He loves to bring it in the bath along with his batman boat and act out scenes from the cartoon. It sure makes bath time a little easier!	2
Decided to buy the whole set, as it was cheaper than buying individually.My daughter loves all her little friends, so this was a great present for her!	2
Nice big pictures and thick lines for my daughter to color in. There's not that many pages but its pretty big coloring book. Same size of Melissa & Doug Make-a-Meal Sticker Pad as a point of reference.	2
educativo, buena calidad para ni&ntilde;as , lo que m&aacute;s gusta es la calidad , se lo recomend&eacute; a los amigos	2
Great for play and just for storing all your lalaloopsy dolls when not in play.  Would definitely recommend.  Nice size too.	2
I constantly get compliments on the earrings and necklace. They are very well made yet are not heavy at all on your ears so you actually forget you are wearing them until someone says something.	2
Our grand daughter is now 2 years old.  We gave it to her when she was just a little older than 12 months.  She loves it!!  Still plays with it almost every time she comes over.	2
This is really a perfect toy... the tote is sturdy and well made, and there are a lot of equally durable/well made fruits and vegetables to go in it. My son loves this and we play &#34;shopping&#34; a lot. He's two years old and I anticipate we'll get years of use out of these.	2
I ordered this for my F645 and it was the same as the original part I worked great. It arrived earlier than the seller said I am totally happy with the part.	2
This is a great item to add to your lego city/town collection,truck was sturdy and stood together once assemble,kids love it,amazon selling it for less than the lego website	2
I absolutely love this game. You can work together or work against each other, or both. This is all in the player's decision on  how they want to play the game. There are many different kinds of cards. You can choose which cards you want to play with in the deck.	2
I love these cups...At time it is not very easy to get the top on, but at the same time you know that your child will not be able to take it off and make a mess. Very durable, easy to clean, tops stay "close" for a long time and all -and-all I would recommend it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game compiles the best features of the classic Sonic games, its fast, its fun, and they even brought back the pinball night zone! Awesome! Plus, there are bonus stages a la Sonic 2, 4 playable characters, and i think Super Sonic is in there too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We have no complaints. Not too many parts to clean, and while I hand wash, I think the glass would hold up just fine in the dishwasher.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
At the time I bought this, it was the only way to get the official wireless controller dongle. I also wanted a controller so it worked out. Playing 4-player splitscreen on my PC has never been easier.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is a great idea! I bought two. Any ice pack works but this one fits around the bottles, lasting longer.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I am a new mom of a 3 month old & I pump exclusively. These shields work great. They are easy to use, wash, & sterilize. This particular size fits well for C cup breast size.Btw, the Munchkin bottle and nipple brush, the one with the sponge at the end, works great to clean the tubular part of these shields.

This is my favorite cd of all time!! I love evey single minute of this cd. This is when eminem was the best ever!! If you don't own this, which I hope you do, BUY THIS!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
What can anybody say about this product? It just does what is supposed to... I got two of these and bought Dante's inferno at ps store.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
a simplistic game : an italian pumbler killing animals by bashing them, made by Japanese, and obviously one of the favorites by Americans (YES Americans love Japanese games)dont know why killing animals and squashing plants is a good idea for a kid's game.so i wont recommend it at all.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
What a wonderful recording! Plenty of good music for all likes! From the sweet and mellow "Writing", the country-flavoured "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy", to the rock-n-roller "Meal Ticket", the album is excellent!! This is just to prove that "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" is not only his best album. This is the landmark of his career! Highly recommended!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Just got the game today and went over my friends house and played 4 player and it was awesome. Great party game and if you are playing with friends.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
great game.lock and load!!This was a Christmas gift and after seeing the advertising on television, makes me want to buy an xbox for myself.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I received these as baby shower gifts and they are wonderful! I now give them to every expectant mother. You can clip toys to them and secure the other end to a car seat or stroller. Put a few in your purse as a great distraction. or just give them a few to chew on. They are a must have!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I am now cloth diapering 2 kids and this has become my favorite diaper bag wet bag.. It folds to be really small but holds an entire day worth of cloth diapers. Which is a feat because I use the biggest diapers on the market.. It holds all the odors in, never had a leak.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Spy Hunter offers a lot of different missions, vehicles, objectives, and a hell of a lot more, all this make this game, worth your $$$	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Celly Cel's Killa Kali is a dope record. A lot of Hip Hop/Rap Fans Sleep On Dude, and I can't understand why? If you love gangsta rap music and don't have this, you've been missin out on one of the best albums in the genre. A++	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is the bomb.  This is what I called the real and truly classics.  My favorite game is Pole Position series and Pac-Man series.  When these two games released back in 1980s, it was a complete sellout.  Wow, this is a game that I feel good about myself.  It is totally recommended.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It's nice to play these again, remastered and on one disc.  The graphics do look better than the PS2 and original X-Box, but don't expect anything unreasonable from games that are a decade or more old.  All three Hitman games were a blast from the past and new trophies were a nice touch.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I purchased this mainly to use at the beach. I was looking for a jogger that would be able to go on soft sand...so perfect. I did a,lot of research before choosing this one! The best part is that the jogger even fits in my little BMW trunk...so easy to fold up...can't say how much I love it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
What more can I say, they refill the Decor Diaper Pail and keep the diapers and smells at a distance.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought this for a baby shower gift because it is so versatile.  It is adorable and I am sure the new mom will love it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought this item as an impulse amazon shopping spree. I actually love it. I love the mouth which keeps stray snack pieces inside of the bowl. Helps prevent spills while being a novelty item for the kids. Cute and high quality!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I don't see the point  to rating this.  It's a memory card, it either works or it doesn't.  If it didn't work then I would've gotten it replaced.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game owns, the delivery owns, enough said. The again what else can you say about amazon?	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We bought this based on reviews, and 18 months later, it is still working. No static and it's been dropped several times and still works.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
bought this for a trip to where it's winter and it was great, warm enough for the cold nights (with some winter pj's).	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this game.  Each new iteration in the series brings something new to the table.  I'm looking forward to NCAA football 14 with Kinect features added in.  Presumably the voice commands similar to Madden.  Love what EA Sports is doing with this franchise and can't wait for next-gen greatness.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Cynder and Lightning Rod are two of our favorites, with great animations and delightful gameplay.  Zook may not have as much character as the other two, but he is still fun to play.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Love this tray. It's a great size for stage 2 baby food servings and it's super easy to get the food out of the tray. Other reviewers have had trouble with the lid, but mine fits on snugly.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
A little hard to squeeze, but the BEST nasal aspirator!!!  Really gets everything out, without having to go in there 500 times.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Completely fun and exciting. This set allows you to play the whole game without every having to change any discs. Easy and convenient. All games are included the story is connected and continuous adding more replay value completely worth the selling price. If you are a true GTA fan go ahead and make this bundled purchase.

My baby girl ( 1yr 3mo ) just loved this set. She starts to 'sing' Dora's song every time she sees the set.  She cant wait for lunch time.  Spoon and Fork really easy for her to grab! excellent choice and nothing bad to say about it.  Great Price by the way.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
You're looking at the best console out there. You thinking about buying a PS3? Heh, don't bother. That piece of garbage doesn't even compare.

It's easy on my eyes and there are lots of different things in this toy for my baby to play with. The details are very thoughtful (hard plastic leaf that acts as a teether, tiny mirror, lots of crinkly plastic) and make this a really great improvement on the usual soft books that are out there.

Out of the plenty amazing Kirby games on the gameboy series, I feel this is the best ( If not Kirby Dreamland 2 is ). It took old school Nintendo game and made better.

We love the Born Free bottles and the nipples are no exception. I decided to order the next size up for my son and take the stage 1 nipples out of the rotation. Plus, I find it's almost always cheaper to order from Amazon! :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love playing the Zelda games. The first time I played Majora's Mask, the final day where the moon falls, scared me so bad that I stopped playing the game for a few days but now I have the game again, I can finally play it through :D	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love and follow formula 1 - it's great to be able to play this on the day before the actual track race... relearn the track and I guess have a bit of a feel or understanding of each event	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I do not like this cup because the straw leaks after it has been sitting for a little while.  It just starts to come up out of the straw and drip down the cup.  Very messy and not worth it.  I like the Zoli cup better although not a perfect cup.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
He uses the cannon a lot and has upgraded both characters. I think he wants another chop chop as he feels you can never have too many.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I like this NES better then the real original one!! Less problems. Smaller.Lighter. VERY happy with this item. Works with all games except one I have.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game was not too hard, not too easy.  Just the way I like them. A little creepy at times too.  In general a nice, fun game.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have 2 of these and have been using them for a year now. They are still waterproof and look like new. Highly recommend!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
bbs is one of the best kh games ever! 3 stories. lots of questions answered. and one super tough boss battle at the end that most people can not handle. the command system is super awesome as well	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It has a nice feature to slide the back rest in a position to feed a bottle to the baby.  So my son can eat his solid food upright & drink his bottle slightly laying back.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Sophie is great!  My son loved this teether the moment it was out of the box and washed.  I'm so glad I listened to the reviews on here - it may be alot for a teether but it's worth it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Oh my gosh....seriously the best bibs ever. My husband calls them a tarp. They keep my baby clean and minimal cleanup.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i don't think this is remastered.it does not sound that way.I'm an audiophile.I love Black Moses,wish for a real remaster with better sound.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My daughter enjoyed this book the most, and it washed well.  Each page has a short rhythmical story and then the animal is hidden under another cloth pull down or pull to the side to reveal the works peek-a-boo and the name of the animals.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was a great game for a bargain price. I purchased it because one of my friends is addicted to it and wanted me to play with him online. They did a very good job with the game and very impressed by it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Found it on Amazon, why buy from Microsoft for $59.99 plus tax when you get it here for a lot less.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We have used this brush for over 1 yr and it is still in good shape. The top has deformed a little bit, but when we get a new one, we will get this one again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
4 epic games in one! Mad crazy hard fights!!! Intense combat!!!! Story that will fill in the blanks!!!!!! Buy this game if you are a real gamer!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I did not end up using these for their intended use as I had planned, but I LOVE these things.  I basically use them for everything else!  WAsh cloths in the bath and now wash cloths for after meals, to wipe hands, face, etc	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Easy cleaning and perfect for diapers. I will buy a bigger one when LO fetsr older. Designs are cute and modern. Love the idea	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This adapter had noticeably less power than my Medela version. Pumping is already hard enough with a decrease in suction.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
An oldie but a goodie.  This is Classic Diana Ross.  There are too many favorites to mention.  Couldnt' get better.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have the Zoli and wanted to try this.  It leaks everywhere, I can't even carry it in my diaper bag.  I may have a defective cup.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Is this an awesome album????...YEAH IT IS.....I've been hearing Paul Van Dyk for quite some time now....his music seems to be much more smoother than most other DJ's...You can listen to this stuff at all times...This music is mindblowing....go get it...I guarantee you that its $$ well spent.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Tupac is the only MC to ever keep you on a roller-coaster. I mean the guy hit you from all angles and left the hip hop nation with a collection of songs that will live on for years. Rest in peace brother...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We had 3 of those in total and all 3 of them broke after a short time.One of them, the hook broke off, 2 of them did not roll back in and the part that is supposed to stick to the window also kept on falling off. I can not recommend this window shade.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this.  It's so great to have your stroller out of the way.  Mine would always fly around in the back and break other things that I had in there with it, but now it stays put and no problems getting it in and out for our shopping trips.  A must for the SUV owner!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought it used and it works perfectly. Having bought several knockoffs this is the one you should buy.Its worth the extra 10 bucks believe me.Also if make sure the product comes with the receiver.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The spout on these cups is not actually soft -- for a beginning sippy-cup-user, these are actually quite difficult to drink from.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is prime time Tower OF Power everything truly comes together as one on this set.the Horns are Slamming the Songwriting&Instrumentation is on point&Lenny Williams knocks it out the box.a must have set from a tight Band.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Best system for 2D, side-scrolling games, though you can now get a lot of the games through Wii or Wii U, so be sure to look there first, assuming you have a classic controller for one of Nintendo's new consoles.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I'm new to this game but so far i have enjoy myself with the story that everytime gets craziermust get part 3 after passing the rest	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this game!  I normally do not put in a review but I am sick and tired of all these "DRM" whiners.  Just don't buy the game people!-Love the EXP system-TONS of weapons-Running over enemies with friends is always fun!-Co-Op is just the best.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great, inexpensive item that does what it says it does.  Couldn't ask for more.  Just bought another one for my second car.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I cant say anything that has not been said already. This may be game of the year. Love it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
As I expected from OXO, all their products are very good, this one is nothing less. Very easy to clean, easy to put on, my son does it himself, and I love the way it folds. Great product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this for my 2 year-old...we are trying to get him to start using a pillow to start his transition to a toddler bed.  This was the PERFECT size for him!  I love the print, and the softness is perfect! Excellent product!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are the exact same ones that came with our Medela breast pump. It's nice to have a spare set!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So simple.The buildup.The repetition.The layers.The deeper meanings in my life.It gets me going and excited. I love it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
very cute. My son loves to wear it and won't let me take it off so it stays on even during bath time It is holding up very well. I thought I would have a hard time putting it on him but it was very easy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I'm not a fan of One Republic.  Some of there songs have been ok but nothing that's really struck me as something I needed in my music collection...until this song came along.  This is a very well crafted song that is really powerful in an unobtrusive sort of way.  Great song for any serious music collection.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is so fun! I never imagined sims 2 having pets. This is an excelent game to get if you love animals. Plus these people have the best prices for games, and they come on time! Thanks for the games!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I purchased these cups and after only a week they started leaking. I would not recommend these cups to anyone.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is cool to play. This game and NASCAR 4 are the only two that will work on Windows 7. The new NASCAR games are made only for XBOX and PlayStation. This game only recognizes the G25 or G27 wheel from Logitech. The wheel works great with NASCAR 4 also.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
there are only 10 playable characters but it is still alote more better then mortal kombat a must buy game	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
great cup!i love how its bpa free..its fantastic that you can seperate the handles too and modify the grip design.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Got this for my grandsons 5th birthday.  He loves playing it, but wants more action.  It is a great game for his age group.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is a lot of fun, but you will need a very good system to run it. The enemy AI is very good; the weapons sound and look great, and the missions are fun. I have not played multiplayer yet. The graphics are excellent. The enemy character models are very realistic...big buff black dudes with machine guns...really cool game.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Really good replay value. Huge world, that can be even further expanded through mods and as a great mod community dedicated to it. If you get tired of one character you can make a new one and try out a whole new play style. (I.E. Warrior to Mage. Mage to Rouge. Balanced hybrids are fun too.)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
When you are playing any Contra you know you've got a good one! Contra 3 for the SNES is no different. This is the game that made me want a Super Nintendo.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
all i needed were the nunchuks.  they are perfect and work well and the cost was good.  I am very happy and would recommend amazon purchases always.  they have anything you need.  at least they always have what I am looking for.  better than ebay	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is a must have very scary game with a awesome story keep u in your toes get it you woul not regret it	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the only PS3 game my wife will play. I'm not that into RockBand type stuff but the game works and has tons of content.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It's amazing how many poeple despise free jazz with no understanding of the music whatsoever.  My advice to them, stick with your Kenny G.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
LOVE &#34;The Price Is Right&#34; Tv Show and this Wii Game is just like the TV Show Fun to Play! by yourself or with Friends! GREAT GAME!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
doom 3 is great . it has everything i wanted in doom 3 and well worth the wait . it is dark and spooky . buy it you will love it .	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I was so sad when our boy grew out of the ducky tub. It was a great transition from the infant tub on the kitchen counter to the giant bathtub.  We used it for almost a year without any issues or air leaks.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is very helpful when drawing a bath for my little one. I always know when the temp is perfect.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These have worked out really well since I started feeding my 7 month old baby food. They have been washed multiple times but still look like new.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i'm not going to review the songs on this excellent album, but just comment on the 2007 remastering, which is excellent.  the songs are clearer & louder but not to the point of harshness or shrillness.  the remastering is comparable to the quality of the Portrait box set.a worthy upgrade.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love all that Trae put out, but have to say this is one of his best yet. If you love this you will love Devin the Dude's new title Smoke Sessions Vol. 1	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great price for all the pieces you get.  They work fine, we like the colors and they wash fine in the dishwasher.  I've only put them on the top wrack so far.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
* Friendliest game for kids.* Good enough to make you jump at the challenge.* Instant rewards at the end of succesful racing.* Great for 4 yr olds.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is perhaps the most fun turn based combat roleplaying game I ever played. The gameplay is wonderful and you really become enveloped in the story line. It may be an old game but it is truely a classic game.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
One of the best final fantasy's, not the best because that tittle belongs to FF VIII, but an excellent game with a nice story and characters. A must have if you are fan of the RPG's	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought 2 of these for my girl twins and they love them.  The cuteness of the potties attracted them immediately and they rarely have accident using the froggy potty.  The potties are easy to take from room to room, empty and clean.  Overall, the froggy potty is a great value.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this dispenser! Each compartment holds a lot of powder, and the rotating, locking lid has a big spout, making it super easy to get the formula in the bottle. I use the big container for &#34;meals&#34; and carry a &#34;snack&#34; portion in the single-serve one.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This diaper pail is horrible. We returned it. It's just a garbage can. There is no sealing action, so you open the top and out comes nasty smells. Also, the can seemed to retain the smell, even though it said it shouldn't. Waste of money.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This an oldie, but great classic Mario platformer. If you love Mario (and who doesn't?) you want to play this game.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
amazing, our daughter hates to be set down at all, but she will play in this for extended periods so our arms get a break! really fun, seems sturdy and safe, and will grow with your child. highly recommend!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The hoop and the pool table are the only two games that are worth playing but they only work randomly.  The lousy user ratings tell the whole story.  Enough said.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I though this product was excelent but  I'm disappointed. Lights but my ps3 does not recognize it. I lost my money. I dont recommend.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Im able to keep an eye on the little one and have some sort of communication with her since she is only looking at the back seat of the car ;-) this way she can see me as well.....	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This towel is relatively big, so it is better for toddler (and not infant) use. The design is nice and the material keeps our son warm after taking a bath.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
