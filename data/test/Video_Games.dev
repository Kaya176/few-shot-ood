Controllers do not work, poorly constructed.  Plus you cannot save progress on the games you play.  If you are a game enthusiast I would reccomend buying a used Sega Genesis.	1
I'm sorry, but they RUINED battle mode in this game....period.Grand Prix is OK, but nothing special...thus, I feel this is the weakest console based MK in the entire series. I hate it, but it's true. Very disappointed. I rank the MKs as such: 1. Super Mario Kart 2. Double Dash 3. Wii 4. MK64 5. MK8	1
90s graphics, stupid storyline, bad controls and gun play, bought it used and that is all it is worth.....don't buy new.  Just looks and plays like some 10 year old game....in the era of Crysis, Dead Space etc, this is just horribly done game.  Those who give it such high ratings much have low expectations.	1
This controller always freezes and needs reset.  I am actually on here now to order the actual Nintendo one.  I will keep this one for the young kids.	1
This is a boring game. The gameplay was losted with this title and there is a waste of money at the end.I bought this game for $30.00 and selling finished at $7.00	1
59.99 I could not understand why this game was so much for pc if you get it threw digital download make's no sense. If they would have had a beta for this game i would have so past on it. If your going to make us overpay for game's on pc they better meet epicness standards.	1
Not very good, A little confusing and boring, I guess kids could play it as well but there are much better games out there	1
I am a tech kind of guy..fix my own computers..and was not able to make that think work.For the average Joe out there I honestly do not think is a good choice.	1
If you looking for a good fighting game, look some place else.  I honestly would be more entertained with Street Fighter 2 for the Super Nintendo.....	1
Cars 2 is good movie. But it has to be horrible with the game. The directions course looks like a glitch called Vanollpe. The cars are slow. The courses suck! Even more stuff sucks. Buyer beware!	1
I have never owned a game that has crashed as frequently as Fallout New Vegas. I've updated my video drivers, rolled back my video drivers, tried every patch and fix I could find. The game continues to crash at least a dozen times a day, usually when entering a building. Shame on Bethesda for releasing garbage like this.	1
my game was very short lived, as i couldn't get past that first scene.  it seemed like something wasn't working correctly.	1
When I got my son an extra set of Nunchuck Controller Combo my son never told me that they weren't working properly until it was way to late, one time I ask him and he told me that he though I would be mad and I couldn't exchange or return because I had long thrown away the box and receipt.	1
takes too long to play and i just dont have that kind of time.  passions is a necessary in order to play this game	1
I got these and sent them back since they look awful.  These are very difficult to put on, and I'm no stranger to putting screen protection on devices I've done them countless times.  As a alternative I used a invisible shield for note 3 and trimmed it a bit and it looks great.	1
do not play this game no pc version yet ! they want you to buy xbox one ! I've superb sli system why should I buy your ddr3 xbox one version come on !!!	1
the game requires steam and an Internet connection!It is notdrm free!I would rather play PC Games without any kind of drm an restrictions like steam, securom or so.	1
Only one side worked and the batteris didnt hold the charge that long. I threw this away within a week,	1
Loved 1 & 2 but this one is just not right. Planes are LAME and vehicles are sometimes too powerful or way too useless. I don't know... I think I'm done with this series. Maybe MW3 should do (hopefully).	1
because I found the game very, very, very boring and repetitive. I love SP ,the show-  I enjoyed the graphics and some things cartman threw out there were hilarious - but the gameplay itself? BORING. returned it to redbox same day.	1
NIntendo is stuck in the SNES era. This game is not next gen. What's the point of having a gamepad if this game doesn't use it. Step your game up Nintendo.	1
I was so excited to get this game because I love BEP. The character change is annoying and I don't like it.The moves are weird, and hard to follow. I still love all the Just Dance games, and the MJ experience better.	1
I only paid $35 for this but 2 weeks after I got it they announce Ultimate. THANK GOD I didn't pay full retail for this game, I also got lucky because a friend of mine didn't mind giving me $30 for this game.	1
This is a great game, but the fact that it is on Xbox one ruins it. If it was on ps4 i would give it 5 stars, but oh well	1
It worked once.... and that's it. I tried using it again, and the LED lights just turn on when I plug it to the outlet and then turn off. It no longer charges. Was only useful for one control, and the charge lasted a couple of days. It's completely unusable right now. Seriously, you'd be better off with rechargeable batteries.	1
Game is actually great... But I have to give 1 star for Atlus's Decision to region lock the game. I personally;y have a Japanese PS3 and cant play it. This was done so Japanese people don't buy the US game since its cheaper. Still, this makes me angry since I just bought it and now cant play it.	1
loved the first two, couldnt finish the 3rd.  Like all great games that become popular, the industry ruined this one.	1
I think the quality of this headset resembles that of dummy cell phones you find in stores like wally world :)It does work though, sometimes. So if you don't depend on clear communication at all times, this is the cheapo for you.	1
Repetitive missions, self centric character and soulless story. Please do not comment under my review. Yes I should probably give it 2 stars but given the fact that this game was much over advertised and UbiSoft cares about money and not game quality, one star it is. I hope this is not where gaming in the future is going.	1
This game is great on ps4 because it is 1080, but it is only 720 on xbox one.So go buy a ps4 for this game	1
You have high chances to lose your money, be careful :/ I redeemed the code many times with different accounts in both my ps4 and Ps3 and it just says error ......it doesn't start to download I feel robbed......I even try with my account in the USA and it didn't work...	1
Calling this a football game is a joke. This is a physics demo that has a "game" tacked on so they can con football fans into sending them cash. There are so many things wrong with the game and it's lack of basic football rules, that it would be impossible to list them all here.	1
WHAT THE HECK NINTENDO!!!!!!!!!!I want to roll, but I can't!!!!!!!!!Instead, I just turn into a stupid painting.what the hell?!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I am a proud PlayStation gamer that wants to play video games, this game sure did not hit the spot. This game is nothing like The Last of Us.	1
Ignore the positive reviews.  This is a horrible and boring game that requires using words and text and it's too hard for kids.	1
This company sent me a USED game that could not be registered. What a waste of my time.Amazon will make them them eat this. You can't scam at Amazon!Cheats or fools, I don't know.	1
It is almost 2014 and Microsoft wants you to put batteries in your controller. What were they thinking? Epic fail!	1
When i got it the spacebar was rattling around like a freight train, and the buttons are spaced differently than my cheap Logitech K120 which made it insanely difficult to use.However I returned it before I could &#34;break it in&#34;	1
...and why does the download in the store cost more than a disc? Is it so much to ask not to have to risk my children's grubby little hands handling a disc?	1
a arabic desert sand color is not a good choice for a game console (i should know, i am well travelled around the world, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and republic of Sahara desert)what makes people think kids would like this??? obviously kids buy 3ds.maybe this might appeal to people living in sandy areas, but the 3ds is region locked.	1
Gave out, and I had to buy from another seller.Do not bother!	1
It took so long to download that I went over my minutes and had no internet for the rest of the month. No prob. I changed my plan and got rid of my air card. Thanks ATT for annoying me into saving money.	1
I LOVE HIDDEN GAMES BUT THIS WAS WAY TO EASY...NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.  DON'T BUY IT!!!  AND WASTE YOUR MONEY I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL OTHER GAMES ARE A LOT MORE FUN TO PLAY..	1
stay away from this, Buy the ds version. It doesn't have any glitches and it doesnt freeze. It works perfectly	1
Downloaded it from Amazon.  Could not get it to play.  Contacted Amazon and they supplied me with a way to fix the issue.  It didn't work, so I am out the money I paid for the game.  Not very happy about the situation.	1
It was a waste of money even though it didn't cost much. But i still regretted putting it on my computer and taking the time to make sure I got it all off of my hard drive and out of my registry	1
This game is a testament that Microsoft still can't figure out a compelling way to implement Kinect motion controls into a game. And the dance mode; that's more a parody of Star Wars than anything else.	1
ps4 mad in china.  of course, it fail.  compare to ps3 made in taiwan (QUALITY)i heard xbone also made in china.  so xbone will be same failure rate.  i prefer quality stuff NOT MADE IN CHINA.	1
It won't Download on origin so basically i paid for a game i can't play it say install and i click it it goes back to install.Ok Update 05/02/2014:I called Amazon and they helped me get the game working now it's working.Star update: 5 stars It's Great	1
Have to agree with the other reviewers, game is boring. Today will be the last day of playing it.Its the same old story, they get my money and I get about a week of gaming.This will be my last game purchase. Dinner and a movie is more entertaining.	1
This game is way awesome, but unfortunatley I ordered it for the wrong platform (PC not Xbox 360 :P)  Buh	1
If this is the best the PS4 can do than its not looking good.  This looks and plays like a PS3 launch game from 7 years ago.	1
they seemed to take away everything that made madden, madden editing players and offline franchise mode have been the staple well there gone someone else needs to make this game from now on EA doesnt care	1
Great games like these should be on the vita, not kid toys like 3ds. come on sony buy pokemon. Nintendo kid fans do not know anything about pokemon or whatever its called	1
I got a gift as xbox 1 and was really eager to play today but it doesn't read any disc.i will give 5 star when Microsoft fix these issue.	1
In the package I received, the screen protector's labels were on the wrong side, so I put the wrong side down ruining it. On top of that, the cord to hold the stylus is too short to actually use the stylus.	1
This game was too long in downloading, even for my brand new computer.  I contacted Amazon, and, although the rep was rather blaise about it, he did offer a refund, and remove the game and the cost from my account.	1
I only bought this bundle cause of last of us thats it nothing really good on ps3. I wish the ps3 had better graphics and better controller battery life.	1
What an epic fail. Once again EA rips off the fans. No wonder they where voted worst company. Complete rip off. Forcing players to play the game online, wait for server connections, all of that crap, even if we're not playing with other people? Morons. Your lucky Amazon won't let me swear.	1
Don't Buy This Game. It's Just Terrible. Graphics Are So Cheap Looks Like A Playstation 1 Game, The Controls Aren't Good And The So Called Monsters In The Game Are So So So Pathetic. Don't Waste Your Money Or Your Time. Stick With Silent Hill. Honestly 4 Stars Rating? Are Ya Kidding Me?	1
If you think this expansion, cough...DLC is fairly priced @ $40 the go ahead and buy it, this is what you will get, one short Act and one class.  Let me repeat, ONE SHORT ACT!!!I don't recommend paying more than $20 for this expansion.	1
For the $14.99 price tag, which is almost twice retail, you would think this would be twice as fun.  In fact it is not twice as fun.  I would stick to the retail priced one.  It will be much more fun.	1
this is not an ok game.  my kids hated it and they never played it .  then got bored with it.	1
While the version of this game works fine on my Xbox, the computer version takes more horsepower than my system has. I thought I had a pretty good system too. I cannot get but 5 or so frames per second with this game making it a total waste of money.	1
Bought it for a Sega Genesis Model 2. The cord fit great but I only got a black screen out of it. My old RF cable got picture from the Genesis so it isn't the console and the input on my tv works for other game consoles so it is just a defective cord.	1
DONT BUY THIS GAME READ THE THOUSANDS OF BAD REVIEWS IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT BUYING IT! EA NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED IN THE FACE!	1
Too much monetization.  Day one $50 dlc cars that you then have to purchase with in game cash or for tokens you can buy with real cash and constant reminders that you can buy stuff with real money wreck the immersion.	1
If you have 2 Xbox and 2 different accounts, You can't play online on you other Xbox. To play the online on you other Xbox you need PAY $10 EXTRA...  This is legal???Hehehe  EA is a nasty company	1
[...]Why does this not support 3D right from the start when the PS3 had 3D for the past 3 years-I guess it's not all in one if you want 3D.  Really pissed.  Non backwards compatible with 360 games and not 3D, this is kids a piece of crap.	1
Oh my GOD is all I can say.Seriously, why buy this thing? It's bad, really bad!Why would you waste $500 on an oversized paperweight!Save your money and buy a Nintendo Wii U!	1
the game dowloaded but never worked on my comp like most the free dl demos, I'll stick to  my xbox for right now and when I get a new comp go back to s craft and war craft.	1
biggest pile of crap ive ever played. enough said. this shoulda been on the nintendo 64 or maybe even the nes.	1
cord is short and kinda clunky and cheap bought it for the wife but neither of us use it cause it sucks so bad	1
This fits loosely and falls off. Returned it the same day it came. Very disappointing. I would NOT recommend this. Maybe check out a local store where you can see how a protector fits right away.	1
Those trailers can be misleading. I should have known since it is so cheap. The game was released in 2009. Lot of people say graphic is not important. It is the content. Well, I can't even bear to look at those big pixels. Guess I am too spoiled.	1
The poor game suffers from bad controls and bad cameras.  I couldn't even finish it.  I'm an adult so I had better ways to waste my time.  Younger games may be able to see past it and stick it out but I just couldn't.And I got it used.	1
this game is full of violence, shooting, killing, and nothing educational. basically, all you do is work with your partner and murder people.no moral of story, nothing.don't waste your hard earned money to sabotage your efforts in educating your child.parents of America, avoid!	1
Game locked up on third mission.  Could have been the CD's fault.  I'll probably try again.  Goood game when working correctly up to where I got.	1
THis game is so incredibly boring.  I played it for about 4 hours, then stopped, took the cd out and put it in the microwave.	1
I thought this would support new 3ds games like pokemon X and Y but it only works for dsi games which is useless at this point. NEEDS 3DS SUPPORT	1
It's been collecting dust so far. Everything that comes out for it I can get it for my PS3/Xbox as well. I don't want to play a lesser port of a console game I wan't original games.The PSP had this problem as well but it eventually built a nice collection. Here's hoping the Vita will too.	1
Amazed of how bad this game is, I got it thinking that it could be a fun game, but it was just the same thing over and over again!	1
i was excited for this... sigh.  really disappointing, i wish i designed games, would be one heck of a castle game that would rival all games like stronghold.  lol	1
They go hand in hand. Xbox has the facial recognition software to watch you and your family in your livingroom. Stop this trend by purchasing a Nintendo Wii U.	1
Seriously ? I had played AC IV for 10 hrs, after i restart my data of my computer, all my process of this game was lost, what wrong with ****ing saving data on your cloud Uplay?	1
I tried... I really tried to like these games.... but they stink, too arcade and childish for me to enjoy, seen it's day, buy something modern like Bioshock 3.	1
substandard graphics, repetetive combat, clunky camera angles, virtually no story or developement of characters, poor-to-no good RPG elements.Sold it back within 2 days of kind of pushing through it waiting for it to turn into something worth playing.  It didn't.Dissapointing waste of money	1
horrible it didn't work	1
Woah..This game is really not good. The single player game is just multiplayer with bots..and boy..they are not smart bots. You will spend the level watching them twitch and jiggle around with no real thought. I was looking forward to this game..and its bad.	1
One of the most repetitive games I've ever played in my life.  Just poor.  Nintendo needs to stop allowing rubbish like this on their consoles.  Brings the good name of Nintendo down.	1
This game runs better on the PS4 due to the demanding graphics. Xbox one is only 720p while this made was made for 1080p	1
i choose this rate because it won't fit onto my 3ds xl screens.i like the price for how much is cost.	1
Never again would I buy Tritton , this mic will not pick up my voice at lease Im yelling into it. I got this mic because it was cheap wish I would of got another pair of turtle beach	1
it is a good game I assume butu my son does not play it, not sure if he does not like it	1
All multiplats look inferior on this console, It's 2014 for crying outloud! 1080p is a must! get on with the times M$!	1
Unusable upon release and some aspects still broken days later (fast mode still not functioning) not counting the obvious bugs that still need to be fixed (fire engines going in a loop while houses burned down, did anyone test this game?). DRM that punishes the paying customer. Completely unacceptable for a $60+ game.	1
Cloud Servers do NOT save your game! Hours and hours of progression lost. Do not buy this game I beg you! Don't waste your hard earn money on this broken EA nightmare.	1
Does not do a good job at securing the Vita, also the grips are way to small. Its simple, don't buy this one	1
It wont let me download it so I just paid $59 for nothing. Ill update it if they fix it. Until then any game orderedthru their digital download will be this.	1
I'm not thrilled by it. I do not recommend it to any serious Gamer.  If you want action look elsewhere.	1
This game is the best mass effect game yet enough expansion content and gamplay mechanics to keep you coming back for more! A must own for gamers period!	2
I would recommend for any age.  It was long enough and plenty of puzzles and hidden object games.  Great brain exercise.	2
The character is unique and fun to use on the game.  Great to watch and learn to use the new upgrades as you collect the money to buy them.	2
Arrived quickly. Not to bad to install. Just have to take your time. Watched the video before installing and that helped. They have also helped my scores. Would recommend them.	2
This game is bringing out the best of all King of Fighters, since the rivalry between SNK Playmore and Capcom.	2
The day I've acquired it, I applied it on my 3DS and the screens work perfectly and protected from my friends.	2
Good like the rest of the Pokemon games. It's nice being able to have your pokemon follow you around in this one though. Shame that you can't in others.	2
this controller far surpasses any i have used to date, the ability to replace buttons with shoulder buttons is awesome, and the feature i liked best was the ability to adjust the analog sensitivity right on the controller itself!! great for switching between fast paced FPS and slower RPGs.	2
I bought this for my daughter, and she just loves it.  She is a girly-girl, but has always liked hunting games.  Her grandma won skeet shooting competitions, so she must get this from her.  Not just a guy game.	2
1 of the best games ever made.  Always an exciting epic battle when I play my friends online, thank you!!	2
I saw other reviews citing how hard it is to remove games from the case, but I've never had that issue. Not a fan of the hard plastic (it looks tacky) but besides that it holds the games firmly and does what it sets out to do.Can't complain 5/5!	2
I have purchase this type of jacket for my previous wii u so I just had to get another for new wii u because it just truly feels so comfortable when holding it and gives it a nice look while protecting from scratches.	2
I don't think that anyone will listen to any bad or good thing said about this game because this game's sales, popularity, character balancing, history, uniqueness, etc. speaks for itself. LOOOOOOVE IT!!!	2
The console is super good. It is a fun experience for me. I liked it and hope it show is more beautiful games in the future. But in some parts of the world you can not use its full potential such as online features.	2
this was fun but some game s  would not play they shall on my computer sme of these game I had played before or had already	2
this is a great collection and for the price better than the eshop and the sonic game a good port for the genesis version.	2
This product saves me space in my room besides enabling comodida to this on the TV and assurance that the same Kinet not going to fall for sudden movement.	2
Are you smarter than a 5th grader is a fun game and even though it's and older version, it worked very well with my Wii U.	2
its pretty soft so it won't hurt your hands if your holding it for a long time.i have dropped it a few times and it has kept my dsi safevary cool get it	2
He seems to really like it. He gets his lcense in a couple years...hmmm-now that's a scary thought. I hope he doesn't drive like he does on the video game.	2
I always wanted a white controller but everywhere I looked it was either sold out or too expensive to buy.	2
Once I bought my Wii u I needed to protect the screen and this package was just the right size and works as advertised. Great value for the price	2
its a good item to have especially when you want the upper hand against the AI in certain instances. i look forward to more purchases from this seller!	2
What a great game at a great price and the disc was new too and that means I still have money left over to buy something else.	2
I've bought this a couple of times just to buy things from mass effect 3 or gow judgement. Quick cash/points for gaming, got the code instantly, very happy guy.	2
This game is neverending. My son loves it, you can do so much in it. It goes on for ever. Now I see why it took them so long to release this game.. The graphics are excellent.. I highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V for the Xbox 360.	2
These are two fantastic games for the $10.00 I paid. Originally I played both on the XBOX but have since traded them in, but I could not resist the price on Amazon. Just a fantastic addition to the Batman franchise.	2
This extension cable rocks. Not only does it work great with all of the PS3 accessories that I threw at it, it works to extend my iPhone and iPad changing cables as well. Also VERY HIGH quality.	2
Bought this for my pc, a tad over priced, but works great.	2
Amazing, comes with amazing game and comes in a unique color. Bought for black friday and have never regretted it.	2
Batman Arkahm Asylum is excellent, and in my opinion even better than the newer Arkham City.I finished the game on Hard difficulty, and it gives a very good challenge, but it IS doable.Highly recommended.	2
this work great I got this for my headset they work like a chram got it for a good price on here. :)	2
Pretty good story, nothing you can't decipher if you've sat through one intro to physics course and heard about Schroedinger's cat.Gameplay is also good, nothing that was irritating except for some instances of fetching and retreading.	2
awsome quality for a small price of 20 dollars. consider buying this item if you want a good wired controle	2
I bought this game for my grandson who is 13.  He says it is a bit challenging, but thoroughly enjoys playing it!	2
This is the easiest multimedia remote I've ever come across. I suggest it to anyone that uses a PS3 for Netflix or a lot of movies. And I'd like to mention that the remote works great with my Samsung HDTV.	2
I spoke with Nintendo today and was informed that if enough people call and request it, that Nintendo will re-release Classic NES Donkey Kong with the Pie Factory level included!!!!!Call Today!!!! 800-255-3700 and select #3!!!!!	2
I got the code immediately without any problems! I will buy some more in the near future. I highly recommend it!	2
I purchased this for my son therefore, I cannot comment on the outcome of this product. Since I have not had any complains from him I is working great	2
I love my xbox, needed to upgrade to a better model, this has been great. I have had no issues with the system.	2
this is a great gamecxant complain this is my fistfinal fantasy i ever ownedi still play it alot.cant stop playing itgreat game it is fun is worth getting it	2
So in anticipation for the GTA5 to come out I bought this and it was so fun favorite of course would be GTA4 but TBGT and TLD were pretty fulfilling in waiting for GTA5. If you like the GTA series these games are a must have to the collection.	2
My daughter and my hubby are addicted to this game since they have it. They started a whole collection of figurines in a display case by now.	2
I love this game.  The animations are superb and I like that you can toggle between Mahjongg and the HO scenes. So if you are stuck, there's another way to move forward.	2
if you are tire of playing first person shooter then this is the game you must try.very unique and very additive and you won't get bore. its too bad that so many people think call of duty is the only game to play on ps3 or xbox 360.  hopefully more different genre game come out in the future.	2
For the price even if you purchased these titles before is well worth it.Amazon has amazing deals on games I have never had trouble installing or playing.	2
It is very good game similar to silent hill for the use of flashlights and stuff but without leaving aside the virus infecting both on the boat I recommend it has graphics and sounds very good, I loved just that not the play late at night after no sleep	2
Good product, and easy to install.  Once installed, they need to be worked around a bit.  Make sure when you put your controller back together that they are straight in, otherwise they may rub on this inside of the clam-shell.	2
If you want fast paced racing, then this is the game for you!  Graphics are great, and the tracks are wild!!  Try to stay on the track if you can!	2
I just got the game no more than 10 minutes ago, and love it. I have always thought x-box was the way to go, but had to have this game. played it at my friends and it is the best. i am glad to get this game and to have switched to ps3.	2
Me and Gran Turismo go way back to gt1... I have so many memories of playing this series for hours upon hours when i was younger. And now that I finally got a ps3.. I can continue my Gran Turismo Legacy!!	2
seems perfect looks great to. i have it standing on it side and traded my old xbox for this oneworked out pretty good cause with the money i saved i'm just gonna get the hard drive for $50. total win win.Runs quiet and i love the sensor thing no more pushing buttons.	2
demasiado bueno el juego la calidad es uno de mis juegos preferidos lo recomiendo en esta edicion al 1000 % no se puede arrepentir uno	2
New to the Xbox world but I was happy to find this controller for such a great price.  Looking forward to many hours of gaming with this controller!	2
The guy at EB said they don't make these anymore so I ordered one from good ol Amazon, I use this to play games on my PC it installs the drivers automatically. If you plan on playing some MMOs like WoW you will need a key mapper program. It works well for every game I play including emulators.	2
This game is awesome.  There are so many variations to play.  I love it.  This game is for all ages.	2
Cannot go wrong with any of the Dance series and #3 is just as much fun,was asked for as gift and person was so very happy to recieve it.	2
The game got here really fast and in excellent condition!  It is an excellent hidden object game.  This is my second I Spy game and it is as good as I Spy Castle.	2
I know that gradually things will keep getting better with more games and more apps and many more features. i am really enjoying my xbox at the moment and pretty sure it'll keep getting better. thank you microsoft and thank you so much amazon.	2
OMG i don't even! The character development & story progression doesn't skip a beat. And there's quite a bit of hidden passageways for those who are looking. Great cinematic moments as well, although i don't know if i should call them that, it looks identical as when you are just running around exploring & attacking.	2
I love this game even if the new characters are kind of dumb and they are missing db and dbgt characters still a pretty good game	2
Flameslinger was one of my first of the skylanders.  I used the hell out of him due to his distance fighting.  nothing better then killing the enemy from a distance! Great addition and solid character.	2
Cant go wrong with this tetris game. Tons of modes and different games in this one. Bought for my sister as a gift and she loves it. Huge tetris fan. Look to get under $20.	2
This was a gift for my grandson and he loved it!!!! He enjoys playing this with his dad and beating him!	2
I finished Arkham Asylum and I was very impressed and how good the game was. This one takes the cake and I was immersed in this story. The controls are awesome and the enemies feel really menacing.Totally recommended for batman fans and videogame lovers	2
Great for all ages! WE love all of the Lego games for the wii!  We want more and more please!	2
Very hard to find character even when the first series was out. I like this character a lot and it was worth the wait.	2
I am (admittedly) a PS3 fanboy however my kids have been wanting this for a long time.  When the price was right on Black Friday, I finally gave in and pulled the trigger.  They have not been disappointed and so far I have, grudgingly, enjoyed it too!	2
When i buy it was a good price for the controller. Sorry but i need more words to complete the review.	2
This product came on time. Im a big AC fan! Will buy more in the future as the franchise grows.	2
This is more fun than Grand Theft Auto because there are cheats you can you to get unlimited ammo and you can go around killing people and blowing things up for no reason.	2
this is the best cover for the vita. all the buttons and ports are accessible easily. best one by far	2
In my opinion this is the best soccer game ever. It has very realistic 'physics' and if you really do ;hard work' learning most of the tricks during the 'training' tutorials, then you can do magic.	2
Purchased this for my son and he loves playing it.  It's not boring and for a tween it's still lots of fun.	2
This has two screen protectors for the Nintendo 3DS. One for the top glass screen and one for the lower screen. Both are needed to keep your 3DS in good shape. Nintendo used a poor glass top screen that gets pits and scratches so easily. The protector keeps that from happening. Also, there is now an easy application method!	2
I use it for Black Ops and it does wonders over the nunchuck. You need it for Guilty Gear Accent Core as well. Just get it and you will find a use for it!!!	2
The graphics were great and it felt like you were right there. It was scary sometimes and it had great story line. The ending really through me. I wasn't expecting it to end like that. It was a great game.	2
This is really great!!!This covers BOTH my ears ! (the headset for the ps4 only allows sound to go to one of your favourite ears.I can hear explosions on both sides.i dont know what the dials do, but they do provide some voiceover entertainment which is real funny.	2
Always wanted to learn to play guitar and this really teaches you in a fun and entertaining way! i can sit and play this for hours, where as learn on my own I'd get bored in 10 minutes. I strongley recommend this product for those looking to learn!	2
This wireless mouse gives you total control.Contoured to fit your hand like a glove. The comfort factor is another plus in choosing this model. With your hand grip molded right in.It is also very sensitive and offers you optimum precision.The cost is well worth it as it's performs excellently.Highly recommended.	2
This is the best basketball game ever. Graphics are awesome and players look and play like real life. I like this game better than 2K 12. Playing as Jordan and his great Bulls' teams is awesome.	2
This game follows all of the Dark Parable series. Can't say enough about the game. I enjoyed it very much.	2
WELL WORTH THE WAIT THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN I HAVE NOT STOPPED PLAYING SINCE I GOT IT! I WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER COPY FOR MY SON	2
excelente juego increible en hd , el producto en perfecto estado, llego a tiempo, el precio muy bueno , lo recomiendo	2
The Xbox controller is really becoming the staple of game pads I think, the form factor is just great.I've had mine for over six months now, and I absolutely love it. Use it almost daily and still no issues. Receiver has a good range, and battery life seems to be pretty good.	2
This was easily to 'install'' and my 5 year old noticed no problems.  I liked it because he stopped dropping the Gamepad (thank goodness we have carpeting).I think it's a great accessory.	2
I had high expectations for bioshock infinite, and I must say it exceeded them all.I played the game three times through back to back to back over the first two weeks I had it just to get everything I could out of it.	2
Good game got it on sale which drives the rating to 5. good game if you like tower defense and mech games. has style of play for the gunner type player making beefy mechs. Or make a mech who makes really good turrets.	2
It's an amazing game, the graphics are outstanding, nice story and it's really difficult. I really like the cooperative missions online.	2
my son played through skyrim numerous times. so much customization it's not even funny. one of the truly great games.	2
excellent game, had  been fan of the game since the very first  GT in PSone. love it. very dificult to take the corners	2
Madden continues to improve each year.. I am guessing people expect it to be perfect.. There is a franchise mode, you just have to look for it.. They changed the name of it, as well. Not a big deal. The only thing I don't like is there is no menu music.. Kind of bummed about that.	2
Well worth the money... Very mature, and one of the best. It's similar to Pokemon because you train demons.. Over 300 of them in all. Everything about the game is awesome... Order it now, you won't regret it.	2
Quick installation, worked without drivers, looks nice and feels comfortable. It has a adjustable DPI setting on my mouse itself which is nice. The extra buttons on the left are nifty too. I will be using this to game with and couldn't be happier.	2
more from the same but people still likes it, soo who am I to tell them dont play this, I just could say "if you like soccer, buy it" is a very nice game	2
This is the first large headset I have purchased...I tended to use the earbuds or bluetooth devices to listen and chat with friends.  I found with this headset that I was missing out on a lot.  The construction and easy to learn controls on the headset are both tops.	2
Got these to go with the Gamecube I bought my boyfriend for Christmas, which came with cables but not controllers. They're great, and useable with the Wii to boot. Hooray!	2
This game is something else on the new Xbox.  Map your buttons and enjoy hours of fun.  Must buy for the one.	2
I own a PC version which I bought back in 2010 and I wanted to buy the Nintendo DS version, so that I could have it, and play it on the go. I just received it today, June 7, 2014. I it is functioning and in great condition.	2
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves to solve mysteries.  I know she will stay up  late, late at night trying to figure it out.	2
I bougth this beyblade for my 6 years kid. The best for him is that it is very strong, spin a lot and has power. I have seen his another bayblades and I think it is the best. It isn't the most atractive for kids but is the winner. (Sorry for my english)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My daughter is 14 months, and so far this sippy cup is truly the only one that does not leak!! And she loves it, she is finally drinking her milk from sippy cups rather than needing a bottle. Now I don't have to worry so much about a leaky sippy cup in my living room!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I started using these when my baby was 1 month old. Its great to not have to scrub bottles all the time! And I believe it helped w/ her colic. I still love how convienent these are.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great reliable toy. My son uses it every night and it is wonderful that it has a timer. I love the timer feature so I don't have to try to sneak in later to turn it off to conserve batteries. It is a must buy!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 11-month old grandson loves his tractor, especially spinning the wheels.  To be honest his Daddy seems to have as much if not more fun playing with it then the baby.  I'm sure all will spend many hours enjoying this toy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Awesome figure, fun transformation and very good for collections. There are some many versions of it, but this one, I think is the most successful	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This gift was very well received by my niece and her two small boys. She said it was a wonderful teaching experience for them; to count, add, subtract, and handle play money. They play with it all the time and it never gets old.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Would not pay what they are asking for it now, but I paid the regular normal price last year.  It's a nice set.  My son enjoys it	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The quality of the material is really good but these toys are really ugly. They look much worse than in the picture. Highly recommend the Lanco brand which is also made of natural materials but toys are much nicer. Got those too and my children much rather prefer those.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This one is not getting much use. Our grandson specifically asked for a cement truck and we even let him choose which one, but he lacks knowledge of what a cement truck actually does. This one will no doubt see more use as he gets older and the weather warms so he can use it outside in the sand.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this bey destroys all the American and almost all of the other 4D beyblades.  I prefer it in attack mode but works pretty good in defense mode also.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Starting our infant on solids and these spoons are great.  Some of the other brands of 1st spoons are larger in size harder in texture.  These are great. Soft and smaller in size....they make it much easier to keep feeding time a bit cleaner.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I purchased this stroller, along with a Corolle doll and diaper bag, for my 2-year-old granddaughter's birthday.  They were, hands down, her favorite gifts and she still plays with it every day.  Her 5-year-old sister loves it, too, although it is a bit too small for her height.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This thing is great. Every puzzle but one fit and it is very large, oversized. Thin, thick all fit. Even some are slightly wider and all fit. Very well made and sturdy. I can get excited because I am sick of pieces of several different puzzles falling out all together. This is going to be so great.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My 1 year old loves drinking out of a water bottle.  This is the best item I have found that allows him to do it by himself.  It keeps the water from spilling, but allows him to get big enough drinks without choking. I have tried other water bottle spouts and this is by far my fave!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We purchased this for our son when he was a toddler, about 12 years ago......and we liked it so much back then, (it lasted for years) that we got one for our daughter who is now 3.

This 1988 release was Brenda's all-time most poular album with the classic hit "Piano In The Dark" becoming her biggest hit ever. Other truly beautiful numbers include "Le Restaurant", "Just A Believer" and the timeless title track.  Beautiful and soul-stirring music from a great but underexposed singer/songwriter.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My grandchildren will be playing with this for a while.  They are more interested in the shapes and colors than they are with the time.  So, when they are ready to do the time they will be familiar with it which is a good thing!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Our son cannot sleep without this in his Graco Pack n Play. The included mattress with the pack in play causes dips and is not very comfortable. This gives him a flat surface to sleep on. He loves it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

There are 'dents' in the bed so the people stay in when my daughter puts them to bed.  The blanket is attached to the bottom so it keeps them covered while they sleep.  The only drawback is that all the furniture doesn't fit in the room.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I started using this item a few months ago and now I can both write and draw.  I'm still not that good at reading, but reading is for nerds anyway.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I actually bought these for my grandkids after reading that &#34;kid&#34; type magnifiers were so distorting and most had bad ratings-TO my surprise these are a great size and are excellent across the whole surface not just the center like the &#34;kid&#34; ones! They are all plastic and frankly I think I'll keep one for myself!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We purchased these for our 2.5 year old son and 5 year old daughter. They are thick and stick easily to our bath wall. My only complaint is that D.J. Lance is not included in the package. Still, it is a great buy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My granddaughter loves this series. She built it in just a few minutes. She's combined the components with other sets to build more projects. Highly recommend it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
6 year old had such a fun time creating this personalized purse. It's easy to create and encourages cognition. The jewels are sticky.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
really loved the product, was just perfect on my daughter, looked good and daughter loved it.nice qualitywill always recommend buying from this store	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This makes for a great gag in my office. I would warn against using this if anyone takes themselves too seriously! Fortunately, I work for the state so I don't have to worry about that. The product has good value and still works after over 2 years.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So cute and cuddly! My 2 1/2 year old loves Bret! He can play with him and cuddle him. Very durable...we've had him for about a year now!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

We had just completed our second season with this tools and they are still in great shape. Grampa's helpers put them through quite a workout.  It's nice to have something that doesn't fall apart after a few uses.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
love this console, much better than the BOB one. better made plus it has bonus pockets on the outside of the zipper pouch = more storage!!!  very universal too!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I got these as party favors for my son's birthday party.  We set up a dinosaur fossil dig in a sensory container filled with sand and these were perfect.  These would probably be too small to use in an outdoor sandbox, but considering the price, these worked great as tiny favors for a party.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this! My baby is so comfortable in this, it's cushioned well, and it also has a pillow that I put behind him.  There are so many pockets, it has fit EVERY shopping cart so far, even the large Costco ones. I am very happy with my purchase.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this baby book. I can't wait until my baby girl is old enough to be able to flip through it herself and learn all about her beginning.  It has space for not only information about baby, but also events that happen around the time baby is born.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We had the standard necks for baby #1, but went with wide neck for baby #2. I don't notice much spit up difference between the two kids, not that there was much in the first place. As long as we use the correct level nipple, they've been great.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought this for my 3 year old so he could play Mike the Night he loves his sheild and sword and I love how soft the sward and the edge of the shield is ... total win win.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The baby loves it...my wife loves the remote..because if the baby kicks it on with a baby foot..and they will you just use the wireless remote to turn it off	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So simple yet lots of fun! Me and the kids had a ball coloring these cool pictures and popping in the oven to watch in amazement the shrinkage process! Love it!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love Melisa and Doug toys. These are nicely made toys.  Propeller on the plane spins just fine without protruding too much to create a hazard.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought it for my 18 month old (he is thin jus 22 pounds, 33inches tall ).  it is cute although its a little big for him the shoulder straps fits well . It hold 4-5 small books a pair of clothes and a diaper .	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was a gift for my one-year-old grandson.  He goes straight to it when he visits.  He tries to figure it all out.  In time, he will have it mastered.  It is great quality wooden pieces, bright colors, well crafted.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The first group album form dipset, and there best.  this cd is fire and its full of classics from juelz santana and cam'ron. i recomend this cd to any santana fan or killa cam fan	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We make most all of our food for the boy and I have to say the one stop abbility with this is awsome it just makes preparring his food so easy, and making his food there is such a piece of mind knowing exactly what is going in his little belly.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
soft fun plush toys that give a different dimension to the mine craft characters. My son loves these and enjoys playing with them.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We love playing this game.  We choose a board game to play 3 nights a week so we have a wide variety and this one is probably the most fun to play!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I.m not sure how much you can love bibs, they are used for collecting spit up, drool and other feeding mishaps, once it gets the job done I'm happy so i guess i love this. These also came with the cute factor.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
came quick, good price, very cute, but kind of delicate material, worked great for the birthday party with little plastic balls in it, child is still playing with it	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is great for travel but also for littler ones who want to play but marbles are too small for choking hazard.  Totally recommend this!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I highly recommend this! I didn't think I'd need it but after the hundredth time of pulling 2-3 wipes at once I ordered it. What a difference! So easy to use and I only get one wipe at a time now. I'll definitely be giving this as a gift to my new parent friends.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are not fancy, but they do the job.  They're clear and are very easy to install.  They fit snugly so little ones can't remove them but we (the adults) haven't had any problems taking them off as needed.  One pack covered our whole house.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the coolest toy! My younger cousins love it. It flies fast and high. It's definitely worth the money. I love RC copters and this one is one of my favorites. Go Superman!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
A wonderful Lovey gift to give & receive.  One stays with the baby & the other in the drawer.  When it needs cleaning, the one in waiting comes out for duty.  Babies love them!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I missed having my glass of wine at night while I was pregnant and with the stress of new baby wanted to be safe.  These are great for that!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This set of think fun is very useful for my child's learning, I can use it to teach my child a lot of vocabulary and it makes him develop a lot of intelligence.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I LOVE these. Not only are they practical for eating out, but they are educational too. I'm a teacher and I love the Baby Einstein products.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
good product - have everithing a little doc will need in case of emergency .... perfect to start .. ..	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great for when your little one decides to potty train at an early age and you don't want to use disposables.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Got this because our other sun blocker broke where the suction caps go on the window. This has no cups, kind of sticks on the window. We like so far. And great price.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
If you don't have any other play-doh products i suggest you buy another to go with this. The set in itself great but doesn't have much pieces. My son has the transformers workshop, the fun factory and Busta the crane so this  set goes well with them.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I enjoyed this as a kid and wanted my grandsons to enjoy it too. They did! We play and I remember the good old days when kids played with each other and laughed face to face? It was a bargain!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our son hated the cold wipes they had us use in the hospital so much that I feared that he would always scream when being changed. This all changed when we started using this wipes-warmer at home. He now LOVES being changed! A definate must for all babies! They should get them for the hospital!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This zippered blanket for the car seat is really easy to set up and insulates really well.  In cold weather it does a great job of keeping out any precipitation and wind.  Highly recommended.Zips easily on and off.  Easy to wash as well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This sheet is very very soft - feels like flannel. Fits the pack and play perfectly and have washed it several times.  Would highly recommend.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My granddaughter was over the moon with this. That was nice, as all products from this movie were soooo expensive it was all I could afford!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought this for a friend's 5 yr old who is very much into &#34;good guy/bad guy&#34; figures. He loved them. They are of good quality and it is a nice set of characters.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Got one for my grandson last year so our grand daughter gets one this year!  Future athletes for sure and this is the perfect toy to practice.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We love this diaper pail. It's really easy to use and it keeps the odor in really well. Will purchase again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 3-year-old kept asking me for 'letters' for Christmas, not sure what that meant, but she received this and was quite happy. It is helping her learn her letters and has even started sounding out which sound each letter makes as she puts it in the slot.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this was easy to assemble and exactly what I needed to be able to bring baby home from hospital in.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These work great with the Melissa & Doug Deluxe Grocery Store. Very realistic and they hold up wonderfully despite the kids pretend eating them (they still scrape their teeth on them). They are easily cleaned and actually look nice in the little store. With Melissa & Doug it's always a win!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I like getting a new set of cards to keep mixing things up! They never disappoint and keep the laughter going!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
ROAR is a good song and has a great message for young teen girls.  We uploaded it to the music list mostly so I could use it in my Daughters DVD that I was making for her.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
They arrived as expected! They are a good quality band for the rainbow loom.  I would recommend these to a friend.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 6 year old was able to put this puzzle together in less than an hour with very little assistance. The colors are bright, and the scene quite attractive. The only complaint might be that it turned out to be too easy for her.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is one of the imaginext toys that I couldn't find in my local stores. It's a great price/value. Holds up to the Imaginext toys I have purchased previous. My 4 yr old son loves this toy but he is a huge super hero/ Imaginext fan.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.  I could tell that she was not very comfortable.  It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.  Also it is very small in size.  If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son loves the app Cut the Rope so when I saw this I knew I had to get it for him And he loves this game&#62; Its easy for him to set up and play. I recommend this for any child who likes the app, and likes games.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 18 month old grandson had just come interesting in Thomas the Train. He really enjoys pushing the train around and making the doors open and close so the trains enter and exist. A Fun and enternaining toy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are cool. My son is 5 and loves them. The entire family likes to throw them on and play. They are pretty well made so they can take on a good fight.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
But after awhile her whining just gets on your nerves. I bought it listened to it for a week or two and then deleted it out of my library and I'm happier without this song.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My daughter used these at preschool and loves them.  I'm so glad I was able to find them on Amazon.  They seem to be a little expensive considering you only get 6 of them, but worth the money.  And washable!  Definitely fun for little kids.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This has been perfect for my little guy who likes to chew on everything! I know he will be safe and it keeps the crib from being damaged as well. I went with the brown so it would match the wood on his crib. It blends in well. I am happy with this purchase!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This mat  is great for a baby that is just learning to crawl or is sitting up. Its soft enough to not heart your baby in case he/she falls and hard enough for baby to be able to crawl and roll over easily.I highly recommend this mat.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is exactly what I wanted for my 8-month old baby--a crib sheet that is minky soft, warm, fits the mattress well, and washes well. If winter were coming, I would order more of these!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I think my teenage son loves this basketball set just as much as my toddler son does! It's great fun for the whole family!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My bottles come out so much cleaner nowadays! I use this thing every day. But if you overload the bottom of the basket, the nipples won't get as clean, just so you're aware. I use advent bottles, and this basket can hold 5 nipples in the top at a time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We use these around our house for rainy days or bored faces.  We use them for face painting.  You just dip the pencil tip into water for about 30 seconds and there you have it.  Draw away!  The best part is that they clean up so easy.  Much better than face paint.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I'm a pumping mom with a lot of parts to sterilize this saves so much time. Before I was boiling water took twice as long and at times forgot the stove was on dangerous. Love this steamer. Use it daily	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
While on vacation my kids' got hooked on the Would You Rather Questions that we found.  So we got the card game for home to play as a family.  It's fun to play with the whole family!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These were available for $5.99 for a period and are well worth that if you are into the Monster Jam trucks.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This thing is great! It's more like an apron than a bib, really. The waterproof fabric texture is more comfortable for baby than something like vinyl would be, and probably more durable too. It's machine washable, and easily wipeable between meals if you don't want to throw it in the machine. Plus this design is gorgeous.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This gift was bought so my kids grandmother could give this to our youngest daughter.  It is a nice gift and nice for her to ride.  She loves it!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
3 yr old can now wash hands without assistance and she loves the little duck.  fits on most handle type faucets. takes a couple of days for them to get how to push and pull it. The handle also folds to the side for easy access for adults.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
its soo so so so so confortable. i never thinks that to pump my breast milk its going to be so easy and whitout any pain, but whit these, it real that wish	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 7 yr old absolutely loves this toy.  She stays outside for hours discovering new things with the binoculars and recording them in the wildlife journal.  Her ipod has gone untouched for an entire week!  All the journaling has led to more research about the wildlife she's been observing.  Excellent "toy"!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Lids are very hard to close. By the time you finally tight the lid to the ice cubes all the liquid inside is spread over the kitchen counter.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The train is just what grandson wanted. They are well constructed and are genuine.  Great for kids that like Thomas	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My grandson received this for his 2nd birthday.  It is so cute and the animals really do make &#34;their sound&#34; when placed in the appropriate slot in the wagon.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I didn't believe the kids when they said it mattered whether we bough the Rainbow Loom or a cheap knock off. Guess what? It does! We have three kids in our house and three looms. Only one is the RL and it is noticeably better made, sturdier and easier to work with.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Purchased this for my two year old granddaughter.  Great stroller.  Well made.  She loves it.  I would recommend this stroller.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
its a game night favorite, its a lil stratagy and a lil luck to this game but very fun!  Its a lot like the Zombie dice or chupacablra all great games alone weve also mixed in a die from other games and made up variations.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
