this album is not interesting, brings nothing new to the rap world, has mentally retarded lyrics most of which are not thuggish or gangsterish but plain stupid. if you are looking for real thug music, check out project pat. this is absolute trash	1
There is not a single bearable song on this album.  No good guitar, no good synth, no melodies, Brandon's voice breaks unbearabley, no dramatic high places, etc.  I loved the first two albums, but after this piece of garbage and the horribly-distorted concert performance I saw of them last summer, Mr. Flowers & Company are done.	1
This music sucks so bad it would make feces smell good.  Green Day suck and this song is possibly one of the worst, most annoying songs I've had the displeasure of hearing.  Die Green Day.	1
1 1/2Aside from few fleeting moments of engaging experimentation, the group's sketchy framework exposes a decayed underbelly of creative drought.	1
There really isnt anything here worth buying. The song is pretty much just a boring waste of time. It isnt the worst song ever, but the music is pretty lame, the vocals uninspired, the lyrics repetitive and passe. Nothing here i would go out of my way to listen to, and would definitely never pay money for it.	1
This is not old school, It is for the young and energy driven. Good dance music not just for listening.	1
This is good listening music for the young; dancing too I guess. Too young for me but I still recommend it.	1
I'm sure this will sell millions of CDs but that still doesn't make it good. I'm sure radio will play it into the ground while other, more talented artists are ignored.What a shame.	1
yea good job BET, this is great for declining the culture of hip hop with suger coated, commercial wack music like this...way to go keep doing you thing, cant believe guys actually like this garbage, these days, even the hardest cats on the streets are turning soft with corny music like this...same goes for Pretty Ricky and Bow Wow	1
I used to be the hugest fan of 50. Get Rich or Die Tryin was nothing below awesome. To tell the truth, i am completely off rap now. i dont know why he went down the path of such a bad 2nd coming.I'll to take 50 to the brain shopSomething made his head go pop	1
I cringed when I saw the 5 star reviews for this abomination of a song. Do you people see how braindead the public are? They just listen to the "popular" stuff no matter if it sucks or not, and well, this just plain sucks. The American mainstream media never stops. Music is dying, and this is why.	1
once again brit is making a whore out of herself talking in those devil like codes we know rock stars love using those codes and swear the public knows nothing about it anyway more techno crap about how brit talking about all the boya and gals wanna screw her.	1
Another poppish album, containing lyrics and beats geared towards females and club going metrosexuals.Only a couple of good tracks, if you've heard their earlier material, then you know which songs I'm talking about.MTV queers will dig this, however fans of their earlier Horror-core style will only find themselves pressing the skip button often.	1
This is by far the most pathetic reunion album in the last 10 years.  Pure Garbage from the fathers of gay goth, emo gayrock.	1
I liked Joss better when he was doing Buffy & Angel, not tired pop songs.	1
The Red Headed stranger he ain't no more.  All the songs here all sound like on long...long...long...uninspired, tedious song, even his classic "Always on my mind" is butchered.  Give it up Willie.	1
Sometimes I'm ashamed to have been born in America. The mainstream media turns talentless idiotis like this into "stars". What filth. I'd rather listen to Megadeth's Risk.	1
D4L and DFB are hopefully never coming back. The wierd thing is that the only kids i've heard listening to this are the rich, suburban white kids that live down the street from me. They turn this up in thier cars and call it real rap. THis is not real rap.	1
this song cusses too much so it is not a good song i will not be listening to this song anymore	1
in the 80s magic was the word beatles had shown the way moody blues&co kept on with talent now everybody is trying to be wellknown&recognised by its violence &stupidity no matter the colour hes white&worst of the team	1
man this is awful why is busta trying to sound like the soutrh he has t pain, big tigger and other wack rappers on here man save youer money on this hip hop is dying.	1
The whining in this song makes me crazy. It sounds like Coldplay's Chris Martin getting raped in a maximum security prison shower. A-awe-awe-all! terrible!	1
I don't see how anyone could truly like this...even if the musicians had some form of talent it wouldn't matter because the singer is horrible and couldn't sing in key if his life depended on it.  Worst cd I've bought in awhile.  Stray clear.	1
Cassidy is still joke. he not hustla. he is just busta a very weak mc. The man can't rap . he is crap. he album doesn't get one. 0 out of 5.	1
boring! when has sheryl crow ever played it  safe? it's like she did'nt even try!	1
Was sort of looking forward to her new one, but a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth your money. Go elsewhere for a hit than this. Not to mention it greatly sounds like "Brave" by sara bareilles	1
Dear Antony:Please do another album where your voice quivers into uncharted emotional territory over your beautiful piano playing.  You are no disco queen.  Stay in your original genre.  Even the song writing is bad on this.A Fan	1
Theres no entertainment in his Lyrics, I don't recomment it to anyone who is mature for there age. ya'll need to grow up and listen to real muzik not that fake s*** this ni*ga come out with.Instead buy or sample Cassidy's "I'm a Hustla" album in stores now.	1
I really hated this song. It's just not my type of music. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but maybe if it's your type of music you'll love it. Just sayin'.	1
Disappointed this is the next single since it's not as good as Running on Heaven and also personally Black Stead are much better songs off the album! This is not gord!	1
I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow.	1
The Reminder by Feist is considered one of the best albums of 2007 but in my opinion, this cd is pretty forgettable. Leslie Feist has a truly annoying and monotone voice. The song I,2,3,4 is just pop dribble. People may adore this woman but she isn't gonna break ground anytime soon.	1
The CD...The Style...The Message is all WACK.	1
She just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio. She's going for some dance-oriented club friendly pop sound but there's just nothing original about it. The same can be said for any given KP tune. I'd rather stick my dog's turd in a vaporizer and smoke it!	1
John mayer sucks....this long haired image he's trying to pull of now with this sissy pop princess guitar playing is embrassing.  Hit the road square.	1
I don't get the hype of this dumb band. Bethany's lyrics are written like they were composed by a middle schooler..and the music is so mundane and uninteresting it would make anyone bored..id rather listen to St. Vincent..A real artist	1
Ludacris Is A wack Mc. He SuckS. Some of his songs will do ,but most are just lame. Child of the night is the only decent song! T.I. is the king of the south not ludacris.	1
Lil wayne is another sellout. He was only good before 2007. He is now a trash talking punk wannabe who should hope eminem or a real rapper asks to battle him live, he would get destroyed.	1
its no good. boring. only one good jam and thats not even that tight.	1
U can tell that this album is low budget. Now that he is getting marketed buy Asylum not DefJam the beat selection is cut down. He doesnt even have money to bring the heatmakers back (only 1 track) the rest are no names. Beats-lame Lyrics-lame. He really thinks he can compete with jay-z?	1
Corny Cam Corny Cam Corny Cam. Never Liked him. Never will. Come on Son! Hov' is so hot right now (and the brotha' retired). Carter Administration can EASILY deflate the deflatable Damon Dash Entertainment. Corny SON! No stars, SON!	1
what are you talking about. Nas and Jadakiss will murder this clown. Nas probally has more money then 50 Cents because 50 probally flushed it down the tank. I am sorry for doing this DI but this review by you was kind of nuts. How about like me you review the other CD off the album and not the biacies.	1
man, what happen over a few months?? this is terrible. Daz should have took the time to put forth some effort in this album. this is bad. not a very good LP	1
Straight garbage. The only song I liked was "Like Toy Soldiers". "Marshall Mathers LP" rapes this. Past Eminem was better. Current Eminem sucks.	1
wow after listening to this album i was like wow this is amazing I've never heard this before,then that baby boomer from Modest Mouse came into my room and was like &quot;uhhhh(sarcastic uh) yes you have.&quot;	1
Wow, this was a huge let down for me. Looks like he needs to go back to the original formula. I don't even feel this was luke warm at best. Sorry for his fans but I was one once but not after this.	1
I stupidly only listened to the sample of this song before purchasing it.  It is boring, repetitious and I immediately deleted it from my devices and cloud.  A complete waste of money.	1
All these rave reviews.... come on we all know this song sucks.  Trash like this deserves one star...not five...not four.  ONE!  Good day.	1
I dont really listen to that much Rock music,but this CD is depressing as hell.Its not good music.I mean minutes to midnight is way better than this album.	1
HURRICANE CHRIS SUCKS. HES DEBUT ALBUM IS THE WORST CD OF THE YEAR. HE CAN NOT RAP HE SOUNDS LIKE MIKE JONES SAYIN' THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME. ALBUM SUCKS DO NOT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Indie [in-dee]noun1. music made 20 to 40 years ago repackaged with less balls by lisping sadsack skinny white people.2. music for people with septum piercings who don't really care about or like music."I'm gonna go listen to that hyped up new indie album after I change my sheets. I had another accident last night :("	1
come on he does songs with closet homos like the dream and jamie foxx that's not gangster plus he's nowhere near the level of nwa or geto boys every song plies does is soft he hangs around that other homo neyo as well toass this cd out the window.	1
Uuuugghhh this album is terrible. When will you hipsters stop listening to such awful garbage? Each time I think you've found the weirdest, stupidest and most obscure nonsense to obsess over, you find something even worse. How anyone can listen to these boring, whiny, wannabe Beach Boy songs for one minute, not to mention 12+ is truly mind-blowing.	1
this album is full of a bunch of bulls***.  it's just another bad attempt of bringing back gangsta rap, but at least it's better than 50's album.  i wouldn't waste your money on this garbage, go buy 2pac and nas.peace	1
Another generic-ass mainstream turd by tha not so dynamic duo of Jlo & S***bull. Anotha song bout dancin in da club and just livin 4 2nite. I'd rather go pick the peanuts out of my dog's doo doo than listen to this.	1
"Waiting..." is a rip-off of "People Get Ready" by Curtis Mayfield...except it's way less soulful, interesting, meaningful or original.	1
TRUST ME I AM NOT TAKING ANYONES SIDE BUT REALLY 50 CENT IS LOT BETTER THAN JA RULE.JA-RULE IS STILL 2PAC WANNA BE. NONE OF THE TRACK IS COOL.POOR BEATS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT BELIEVE ME IF U WANNA HEAR SOME GOOD RAP, BUY ANYTHING BY 50 CENT OR EMINEM.IT IS NOT A RAP ITS CRAP.	1
I abhor this song (look that word up, or just guess it's meaning). I also don't like Lil' Wayne's music either. However, there isn't one song by that rapper that I like less than this wretched song.The writer (and composer!) needs to be given a good shake for composing such drivel.Everything about it is just plain horrible!1 star.	1
Tired theme, annoying as hell, horrid ear gouging vocals and vomit inducing twillight propaganda. Complete gutter polish trash!  Avoid if you have any taste in music whatsoever!!!	1
50 was already ripped, is this 'photoshop',or did he bulk up to olympian standards? The music is horrible. If you like  the muscles, go the to the Mr. Olympia contests, and see the real thing.	1
This is over-polished, over-dramatic, stadium pop.Was a fan before hot fuss. have the bootlegs to prove it. This album is weaker than Sam's town even. the lyrics are laughable. There is no trace of the harder synths that made Fuss brilliant. the killers are artistically dead.This is not indie rock n roll to me.	1
Read the title... this album is about as wack as it would be if your grandma wrote it...This album made me respect Bubba Sparx more, never saw him as anything special but in his baddest day he couldn't make any song as bad as the ones on this album...	1
Thank you for killing hip hop with your wack ass. Thank you so much. I really admire young jeezy for that. The music is sooo good. This album is a classic. Yeah right punk.	1
I don't -hate- Lady Gaga, but this song is just awful. I heard it in Las Vegas while looking at the CSI gift shop, and my reaction was wanting to puke. "light me up, put me on top, let's falalalalalalalala"?! What are you 13 years old.Cherry cherry bomb bomb.	1
If i could give this CD zero stars best believe I WOULD	1
I think this was a free song I down loaded to get the full version.  Once I down loaded it I didn't really care the full version.	1
The only song on this complitation that is worthwile is "I Don't Want To Do It" as it was a one off for the Porky's Revenge soundtrack CD.  Everything else is available.	1
TI is okay when you get right down to it Flip is betterWe Got Next is great.... better yet check out Devin theDude - Smoke Sessions it Hot... Plies Real Definitionsis one to watch... if you are going to byone album this year buy Smoke Sessions	1
Why does she keep holding on to this album? Is it because it was her only bestseller?	1
hello,we all enjoy carole king songs...but, this one sounded like she was down with a sore throat.  comparing this song with all of her other big time hits was painful.  yrmv	1
cam should get popped just for being himself his whole career is a joke cam can you please kill youself and take crackhead looking jim jones with you and jewell santana.	1
Can it get any worst than this cd? Let's see on his next cd.	1
trash, i rather listen to mc hammer then this clown. most wack rappers atleast have good beats. this wack rap is killing the genre	1
What's even sadder is that it has spawned a bunch of ripoff version. it's like caca begat caca. It's quite possibly the most annoying song I've heard in a while	1
If you need an answer as to why every alternative rock station is switching to a smooth jazz or spanish speaking format, look no further than Incubus. Generic pop-rock dressed in trippy lyrics and nu-metal turntables. Gimmie a break!	1
Another wack group to pop out of ATLDFB are just as wack as D4L.Plus this isnt crunk rap people. Its Snap rap, D4L are the same thing. They take really boring wack beats and spit wack rhymes over them. It takes no skill whatsoever.Listen to some real	1
a hasbeen rapper wack beats trying to hard to be mainstream his career is through.	1
Not an original song on here.  Ugly as i seem is a blatant rip-off of Dylan's "I believe in you."  and Aint that Lonely Yet was a Dwight Yokum song-title and conciet about ten years ago.  WHy this band is so popular i'll never know.  Oh, wait, i know.  They rip-off better musicians!!!	1
More Christmas Music?  Why would I order Christmas music oin February?  Please reverse this &#34;purchase&#34;.  It gives me a bad taste in my mouth about my new Amazon Kindle.  I am beginning to be afraid to use it.	1
I just had listen to some of the songs on this album and it is all bad.Nora Jones voice isn't as good when she sang &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;Nora Jones won't pull off a Grammy off this album.	1
it's too bad interpol has moved away from their joy division influence..because i was really hoping they would hang themselves....	1
There is not one tune on this CD that sounds remotely close to 'Whip It'.	1
The lyrics are really whiny, dramatic and crazy. I used it to show what an unhealthy relationship is like in a presentation. Its just over the top and obnoxious really.	1
this might be the worst cd i have ever heard. there is only 1 good song on here, snitch.  the rest of this album is so bad its rediculis. dont buy this	1
this album was hard to feel and it is mainstream. pure horrible and too mainstream im sick of these rappers sounding the same. GUNIT IS WHACK AND LOST MY RESPECT. IF eminems new album encore sounds like this, im gonna freak and eminem is gonna lose all of my respect.	1
Good single surrounded by rubbish. as usual it doesnt take much to get "indie" critics excited. d/l the dance floor single save your bucks for BRMC, the bravery...the faint...strokes etc.	1
Ok first off, when you listen to "Everytime We Touch" you're done because the rest of the cd is EXACTLY the same. I have tried and tried to listen to the whole cd, but I just couldn't. It's very annoying to listen to!	1
Ludacris is bad. VERY BAD. I don't like any of his songs and he stinks. Just like I saidfor Eminem this guy would never be ever to survive in a third world country. As they would say-WORD	1
Only good song on the whole cd Is #12-Hennessy. Other than that. The cd is just a bunch of No talent rappers on there (except the Outlawz) trying to get cred for their names, Sad that Tupac's Mom Is profiting off her dead son(who she never raised proper) sad. And besides that, There is nothing like the Original.(mixes)	1
It's almost unbelivable how they completley made these good songs pure garbage... most songs are remixed incredibly bad , only one song stand out which is the remix to 2 OF AMERIKKAZ MOST with Crooked I instead of Snoop, however the orginal is much better...Don't waste your time on this BS, Suge only wanted to get easy money...	1
BIG DISSAPOINTMENT! documentary = classic. doctors advocate = classic. lax = classic. the red album = big dissapointment.i cant believe it	1
I've tried to love this record, but Drive-by Truckers have honestly lost their edge on this record.  I hope they don't keep going this direction with future releases, since Go-Go Boots is obviously a big disapointment.	1

Red Light District is sound, but there is no music.  I have no idea where Ludacris came from.  But he has got no musical education.This is a disgrace of talent.	1
H.I.M. DOES suck ass. Just read OA and Eggplant's reviews, they speak the truth.Boycott this turd, buy any Dream Theater album instead; the guitarist from HIM can't play a SINGLE lick from any of John Petrucci's solos. This band is about as goth as dogs taking a piss.	1
Yayo is simply a garbage rapper, and to top it off he has a hugeass ego. This whole album is trash except for a few of the guest apprearances but i mean you shouldn't buy someone elses album for the appearances. Yayo shouldve just stayed in jail cause he doesn't belong in the rap game.	1
Only a couple of good songs and most of them are apsolute crap they messed with 2Pacs music and completely butchered it.Lyrics 8/10 Production 1/10 X Factor 1/10 Classic 1/10 Me 3/10Overall-14/50=28% This album will get 1.5 Mics yuck	1
Is it just me or does this song = "Somebody I Used To Know" (Gotye)?  Derivative, auto-tuned to hell & irritating as usual. Another classic from Hannah Montana. thankfully, this one won't last long, either.	1
Although the music porition of the cd has potential, the singer has a horrible voice. I am surprised not more people have noted that she sounds like a chipmunk. Like past AI winners, this is a sore loser in the end. Bleh!	1
don't get me wrong, 2pac is great, but posers like 50 cent, eminem and various others really dont deserve to be on a track him. I bet pac is turing over in his grave, i mean, what if he were here to see this? Why cant they just leave the tracks as they were instead of "remixing" them? R.I.P 2pac....	1
Okay I'm no song writer, but I run this album in my multi-disc player!!!  The bonus tracks are so nice.My favorite tracks from this album: Best Friend, Boogie 2nite, Motel, Call Me and of course Oops.Purchase this album and you won't be sorry.	2
I am not into female artist there are not many I like ,but I have to say that Florence has a great voice and a good band supporting her. she has a powerful voice and through a good Hi Fi system she sounds great.	2
This is a great album it Is 50 Cent's BEST. It has alot of hits like 21 Questions, In Da Club, and WANKSTA. This whole album is great.	2
add to your collection of cole's recordinmg. She can do no wrong and you should purchase it and give as gifts	2
It has a catching tune and the lyrics are about relationships that are meant to be in love. .Hope that this song will bring two people together in their heart's. .	2
Eminem is a genius. I love all his CDs. He is so funny, plus how does he think of these things? Genius, I tell you! Great CD.	2
This was very good , love her voice in this song it was also very clear and easy listening. Gave it a 5 star rating it was real good and would highly recommend!	2
I love her voice! Love every song!  She is new, with an old soul. This young lady sounds Great! Buy this CD, you will love it!	2
I love all that Trae put out, but have to say this is one of his best yet. If you love this you will love Devin the Dude's new title Smoke Sessions Vol. 1	2
I'll make it short and to the point....when you have hip hop luminaries like Dre, Andre 3000, Big Boi, Game and others backing you...how can you go wrong? If you're a true hip hop fan-get this album!	2
This album is spectacular. Some of the songs are just so powerful, like "I Can't See New York" and "Carbon" (which the constant piano rhythm reminds me of "Siren"). Other songs are just so beautiful, like "Strange", "Your Cloud", and "Gold Dust". Others rock, like "Don't Make Me Come to Vegas" and "Sweet Sangria". The whole album is another masterpiece.	2
these guys are great together but they can pull it off by themsleves to this double cd is priced great and you get two sounds for the price of one I like Big Boi's cd the most overall but Hey Ya is a greta song and Andrei 3000 is my favorite member of the group	2
Love this song.  It is so relaxing. Would make great dinner music for a Christmas party or great for just chilling	2
Have wanted this album for ages, and it does not disappoint.  It does sound like music from the 80s, but hey what is wrong with that.  Have only just got it, listened to it and just love it, can't wait for the next album from Ladyhawke.	2
I'm not a big fan of Folk music, which is what this is classified as, I guess?The lyrics are so fair and true, simple yet profound.  I listened to this over and over recently while working on something and it was like mental Yoga.Fantastic!	2
The Deluxe Edition has 4 BONUS SONGS (So Gone, We Loved It (f. Seal), Aim High, For The First Time).  Takes Love in the Future to that next level especially We Loved It where Seal just kills it!	2
Dashboard is awesome and If you liked showoff check out chris from showoffs new band Farewell My Enemy at [...] they are really f'n awesome.Tom	2
That's what this is. A fresh look at a musical icon. Great "all around" performance, package, title ok, recording, etc... Worth the time to listen and enjoy. Down to earth. Whoever came up with this has done Jimi well. I am happy to have listened and enjoyed it....	2
he's got a blunderbuss that will smash your holiday pumpkins and toss your rag doll out in the street!! how cool.	2
this is an awesome cd by these guys as always hard heavy riffs thick drums and awesome lyrics. buy this now	2
...simply beautiful.  Her voice, the lyrics, the melodies, the instrumentation, everything.  Excellent use of strings.  It's not a happy album, though.  I'm OK with that, but I wonder if Sheryl knew, subconsciously, that her union with Lance was doomed.	2
Cam'Ron just prove he dont need Jimmy and Julez to make a good album. This album is more for the streets but itz very good. O look for Cam's new artist "VADO" he is up and coming. Top 5 songs Cookin' Up, My Job, Get It in Ohio, Silky, and Who	2
This is a fun, upbeat album that has just the right amount of catch to it. I had heard a couple of the tracks before on the radio unknowingly, and happened to always like them, so this was a nice surprise. IMO, the evolution from the first Broken Bells album is definitely a positive one.	2
this is one of my favorite songs and I love it. I would recommend this to everyone and I listen to it all the time.	2
I actually bought the past two albums and this band keeps growing and getting better. For some reason I could care less about seeing them in concert. That being said their past two albums and this album are excellent.	2
I wanted lots of Christmas songs to brighten our ride to the in-laws and beyond. Though I dint use them much this year. But this is a great copy.	2
We need more acts like floetry in the music biz for those tired of the usual mtv-bet bullcrap we see everytime dj jazzy jeff is shedding some light to the bling bling disease with these 2 talented girls along with jill scott, and musiq I would get this definetly.	2
This is such a catchy song.  My family loves to listen to it.  It would be great to play at a party, even a wedding reception.  I really like Carl Rae Jepsen's vocals.  Buy this song and have fun with it!!	2
Great Song. She speaks great about the ENERGY OF LOVE. It is put together with Great Melodies. Great Price. Worth The Buy.	2
I play this in my car and put it on repeat.  It is very catchy and I love the music.  You can't go wrong with Bastille anyway, but I think this is one of their best.	2
I brought this before all the VMA events...I brought it because she has a beautiful voice. She still does.She can song anything a nice ballad or pop song...it doesn't matter !  She can sing.	2
this is a great but 50 cent just swears alot so the clean version sucks cuz the eriting takes out a few words that arent even swears. So if u are looking for a good album get this but  just not the clean version. I by accidentaly got the clean version :( LOL anyways trust me	2
This album is da bomb! Ja mixed that murda, murda (tracks 7,8) love songs (3,4),his faith in the Lord(1), and humor(9). Chris Black the skit was stupid though. My favorite tracks are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,14, and 16.	2
This is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd isDisc 11. Wordless Chorus3. Gideon6. Lowdown8. What A Wonderful ManDisc 23. At Dawn6. I Think I'm Going To Hell8. Dancefloors10. Mahgeetahif you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do	2
Eminem shows off his complete skillset in this album and makes songs that are often thought provoking and fun, with out losing his hard hitting no holds barred edge.	2
Always been a fan of this hot mess! This song makes me wanna speed down the road in my wreck of a car	2
Great Album By Mary J. Blidge. This is the second Album Of Hers I Purchased, and another Album Where All Songs On It Are Hits. This Shows The True Talent Of A Musical Artist. Great Price. Worth The Buy.	2
when i would have a party i would always have this song then me and my friends would jam out all night long	2
this is the best eagles compilation hands down.it features all their big hits like new kid in town,life in the fast lane,teqila sunrise and more.hugely recommended.a must have for every classic rock fan.	2
As a big time Killers fan I bought this album just to get the two new tracks and it was worth it. Even though I have all their albums, listening to their collection of hits all at once was absolutely fantastic, and getting two bonus tracks was a delight.	2
Ready Or Not by  Brigit Mendler is a light-hearted tune that seems to be about happily being ready for whatever may come in life. Ready Or Not is an upbeat pop music type of tune with a summer feel and slight hints of dance.	2
I love this album, the music is obviously great, but the sound has an extra something to it on vinyl. It's something that any vinyl lover will appreciate and enjoy, the subtle crackles in the background are something I enjoy, but it's also super clear music.	2
Stop writing these punk @$$ reviews. It you don't like Kelis just because she is blunt with her attitude, then don't buy her music. Seriously, nobody wants to read about your stupid @$$ opinions. There is no need to write 2 reviews with one star to bring down her rating. Love Ya Kelis!!!!	2
There are at least 4 hit songs that could come from this CD.  Rolling in the Deep is the first single the record company is pushing.  The others are Rumour Has It, Set Fire to the Rain, and One and Only.  This could be on the charts for a long time.	2
I have heard this song so many times I new I needed to buy it.  Best song ever by beyonce	2
Mos def 1 of da best of da seasonOnly weezy bested dis boyA A AJuelz is in da game	2
Every song is a banger that takes you on a ride from the 90s to now. Make sure you get yourself a copy.	2
I remember this song from when I was little. I bought it to remind me of when my parents would play this song to me in the summer. It's even better now than it was then.	2
if you love this track check out his homie Devin the Dude Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1- track 3 getting high is something to smoke to - whoah - this is the first album since Rapalot Days and the first album of Devin's to hit the Billboard Charts - Congrats	2
classic hank 3rd ps re instate hank sr on myspace hank the 3rd is the real deal down the earth artist song writer that push's the envelopewhere were to afraid to travel inhis shoes	2
WONDERFUL AS ALWAYS SO FUNKY!STOP HATE-IN(I MEAN THAT) ON ERYYYY!I LOVE THIS SISTAS MUSIC!SHE WILL FOREVER BE THE BEST, AT WHAT SHE DOES!A BEAUTIFUL SOUL SISTA!SHE IS SMART AND CREATIVE!I LOVE HER!!!!	2
This song reminds me of some wonderful memories and make me want to plan some new memories with that some one special.  I can listen to this song over and over again.  Talk about a beat that calls you to your feet and just move.	2
This CD is tiiiight! I like a lot of the songs on here. This CD is Nas's best so far!	2
...Every song on this record is a winner and the DVD makes it a very nice deal.  I really enjoyed hearing the songs from "So Impossible" backed up with other instruments ("For You to Notice" was especially great).  I am eagerly waituuuuuuuuun for their next album.	2
so i really enjoy the dark sounding lana but she trys some other types of sounds here that im not big on but overall this is a very good album.	2
This album was really good have always like Ice cube's stuff no matter what....still a big fan! Also recently checked out some new stuff from Lil Keke "Seven 13 Hustlaz" that joint is also another hott album from an older generation...pick it up!	2
for the price i paid, this was a steal...great raps awsome beats, perfect for the car........just don't get pulled over	2
I love this song, but Kelly is a freak, sex sells so she is on the money train. Hope she has more good ones on the way.	2
I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it.  Upbeat tempo, positive lyrics and easy to sing along to which is a must, lol.	2
In my opinion he has the strongest Michael Jackson sounds while knowing it's Bruno Mars. The only one close or equal is Chris Brown. But Bruno has made it a point to have his music very different the MJ's. Sounds like him but the music's beat is not as hard.	2
This album is banging. this is one of the best albums this year. every song is great. the real king of the south is my boy P.T.	2
This is a roll your windows down and crank up the sound kinda song. Simply it is a fun song.	2
Also found this on daft punk's also-boughts. I feel like I have been taken back to the BGs, but more modern. Fantastic!	2
Tanya was one of the good lady singers back then and I liked her tnt album also this one good to	2
I still remember hearing this song for the first time not really paying attention to the lyrics. Now that I am older, its kind of funny yo listen to and still very catchy. Great song.	2
This double album from RHCP is amazing. Frusciante and Flea tear it up and both discs are great.  Good songs all over the place with these two discs and it is very much worth it if you are an RHCP or rock fan in general.	2
You can hear it (and see the video) on Great American Country (GAC-TV) at present.  It's a really catchy tune--even if you're not a diehard Country music fan.  It's in the Modern (vs. Classic) Country genre which I personally like very much indeed.  Enjoy!	2
elton john is the best musician in the world and this album proves his geniouse all his songs are great	2
There are oodles of Eagles best-ofs out there and this one is the by far the best one!!! All of their big hits are collected together in an awesome 2 CD set!!! The first pressings include an ultra cool DVD!!! Five Stars!!! A+	2
I absolutely love this song, it downloaded fine, and I would recommend this song.	2
The reviews really helped me decide on this purchase. They are an under appreciated underground group to say the least! This is a must for all Dead Prez fans.	2
The album by Travis was a pleasant surprise. The music was a lot better than I expected. I only listened to a few tracks before I decided to buy the CD and when I finished listening to the entire album, I loved it!	2
MARVIN COULD GET ONE IN TROUBLE AND BACK OUT OF IT WITH HIS STYLE OF SINGING. THE MAN WAS BAD AND REMAINS IN THAT STATUS. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MARVIN GAYE, NEVER!!!  I GREW UP WITH HIS AND STILL HIS MUSIC HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON ME.  LOVE HIM	2
DMX's 4th album is straight dopeness...he comes with much more anger in his voice....the beats and lyrics are off da hook...I just cant get enough of &quot;Who We Be&quot; (that song is straight hard) and &quot;We Right Here&quot;...not to mention the other dope cuts on the album....Cop this album for sure...it's a definite must buy...peace.	2
Love to listen to this one because I do belong with my sweetheart. I just tell him I love him when I hear this!!	2
This group is new to me. I learn of them on American Idol last season.This is my favorite song...also like Decode.	2
There is not a whole to say because it's self-explanatory. It does warrant a high rating. Kelly is doing her thing with her music.  May be a controversial issue to many, and appreciated by others. The choice is yours... For ADULTS ONLY.	2
This album was as raw soul as you could possibly get. Marvin really layed it down on this one. "Let's Get It On" is still that deal and will stand the test of time.	2
Demi has definitely gone through a lot and you hear it in her voice on this song. She is vulnerable and yet strong enough to stand up for herself	2
THIS IS A CD YOU GOTTA HAVE, I BOUGHT IT 'CAUSE I LOVE "PLUG IN BABY", "NEW BORN" & "FEELING GOOD". IF YOU'RE A NEW FAN, THIS IS A GREAT CD TO START YOUR MUSE DISCOGRAPHY.IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN, BUT YOU LIKED A SONG OR TWO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BUY THE SONGS INSTEAD THE CD.	2
What's not to love about this song?  It's upbeat and fun and really gets you motivated to dance, work or anything else.  My only complaint is the line &#34;no Lennon or Zeppelin&#34; makes me feel old.	2
The music is both new and classic.... beatlesque, psychelia, new wave, indie and classic rock all in one package.  Cannot stop listening to this stuff!	2
I love this song - it's full of energy and the music is very catchy. Great vocals and a consistent sound.	2
A VERY UNDERRATED RAPPER FROM NEW YORK! THIS  WAS A EXTREMLY GOOD TELL A STORY THREW LYRICALLY EXPLANATION! ALOT OF TODAYS RAPPERS SHOULD HAVE THE SKILL TO DO SO! WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM ITS LIKE YOUR WATCHING A GOOD THUG MOVIE! THIS CD SHOULD BE IN EVERY REAL HIP HOPPERS TOP TEN LIST!	2
I definitely play this CD all the time. Slim Thug be rippin' hot lines. He got talent and that's all I can say cop this album.	2
This album is brilliant! Adele's album on vinyl has a great black and white insert in the record album case and that just adds to the overall brilliance of this album. The songs are all great and having this on vinyl is really something special!	2
I remember this album when I was in the 11th grade. I love this album and it is tight. The album overflows with funky music and creative lyrics. This album is filled with funked-up grooves, provocative storytelling and b-boy swagger. This album is the soulful sound of rap music surviving. This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004.	2
They are two musicians who have collaborated on numerous songs.The perfect guitarist and the perfect folk singer!Their great harmonies makes this the best CD	2
I was afraid this band was going to be a one-hit wonder, but they're proven their versatility.  Love the lyrics and orchestra.	2
very good cd, good production by eminem has some really good beats to the songs and very good lyrics by 2pac. even though some songs like loyal to the game i really don't like the idea of them speeding 2pacs voice up. but other then that get this cd its very good. R.I.P. tupac amaru shakur	2
This album is brimming with fun! Not only is it my favorite Dandy Warhols albums, but it's also one of the best albums of the year. The lyrics and music automatically put a smile on my face.	2
I listended to this album when hip-hop, R&B, and all the other genres were, well, going dead. Nelly brought a fresh and innovative sound no had heard before. Her experimentation with Reggea, Rock, Rap, Soul, and Portugese music blend perfectly on this album. A definte must have! Hey it made a fan out of me...	2
This song proves that it takes nothing more than a piano to accentuate a great voice. Filled with emotion and a beautiful softness, this may be Rihanna's greatest song.	2
there came a point where i was blacked out on booze and watching the video for "c'mere" and i thought, "my god, these guys are probably the most original thing ive heard since arcade fire"	2
Nelly has an amazing voice, she just keeps reinventing herself...Awesome Cd...Truly Reccomend it!	2
This is a funny song and i use it alot in my class so glade i could get it on a download and it is so easy to do. thanks	2
another pop and country duo love this song alot when she teams up with a country artist it is magical a must have	2
This CD has all his greatest music and the quality is good. The case was cracked but it's ok I can live with it.	2
I love listening to new artists, how they almost sound like original, they also have their own kind if style. keep singing	2
IF YOUR A LUDA FAN OR DTP OR A DOWNSOUTH FAN, THAN YOU'LL LIKE THIS CD. THIS IS A COMPILATION TYPE CD, JUST SHOWING OFF WHAT DTP HAS TO OFFER. IT HAS SOME BOUNCIN DOWNSOUTH BEATS.	2

This controller is awesome because you don't ever have the change the batteries.  I've had my rechargeable packs for something like 3+ years and haven't had to replace it.  Do you know how many batteries I would've gone through in that amount of time?  Too many.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I read reviews for other placemats, some were too thick, not grippy enough or too sticky..... This one is perfect. It's easy to clean, not too thick or flimsy. it can even get rolled up and travel in a diaper bag.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son wanted this so I got it as part of a xmas gift. He has been using it since he got it and it still works perfectly.

Soft bristles, rounded balls protect the comb teeth so they don't scratch baby's delicate scalp, it is the perfect sized set for their first brush and comb.

I purchased these as stocking stuffers. Some had a mild electric charge while others were freakishly strong. I made sure I wasn't standing in water when they were around. They went in the trash.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It's a good game, and for $5.00 you can't really beat that.  Newer games have slightly better graphics but this is one I think you will enjoy even though it's been out a while.  You may also want to pick up a copy of ME2 ;)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Don't waste your time or money with this. They are VERY uncomfortable and actually hurt me while pumping with these breast shields.... I should have listened to the customers who wrote bad reviews on this product!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This product can be used on any stroller and have lots of other uses in that the straps are long enough to attached to many other products, i.e., highchair, crib, bicycle, etc.  It is large enough to hold lots of toys, diapers, bottles, or just about anything you or your baby may need.

The hype is believable. These washcloths have been great for giving my fussy newborn a bath. She likes to have the washcloth draped over her tummy and this fits the bill!

Our 3 year old wanted a Flynn for Christmas. This did it. Fits on the standard wooden Thomas train tracks. Same quality as the other wooden train components.

This worked as a nice jumpy toy for a home with odd sized door frames.

I like the games where you can choose how difficult to play. I decided to try the expert mode, and found this a nice challenge.

Pros: large, lots of pockets, lightweightCons: the material is cheap and frays quickly, the pockets gape and sag awkwardly when u put things aside, he bag is extremely floppy and doesn't hold it's shape.Overall: you could probably find a bag of similar quality at family dollar for under $5	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Seems like a lot of money for a baby sleeping bag, but it is quite nice.  Warm and cozy and cute patterns, and I LOVE the fact that the shoulders snap open.

I gave it 5 stars because the cute graphic, the sound is clear with nice music. The game is fun: match 4, you'll have a bonus (the Jewelquest doesn't have this). I play it everyday.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've been very pleased with these sheets. They're the perfect size for our Chicco playyard. We also send them to our baby's daycare because they fit those cribs perfectly, too. They wash and dry well and are very soft.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I purchased this doll house for my grand-daughter's 2nd birthday and she absolutely loves it.  She plays with it constantly and it encourages her to play by herself.I would recommend this doll house.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My daughter loves Toy Story 3 & carries all of these in a little box. She plays with them a lot.They hurt if you step on them. Good price, nice item.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
As far as headsets go this is the most basic bottom of the line one you will find but after owning Tritton's, Astro's and Turtle Beaches I very much enjoy the basic principles of these headsets. Only one wire, plug it in and game! simple, easy and basic!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Very fun and addictive. Highly recommended to anyone who likes a good challenge and likes to figure things out for yourself rather than be lead around by the hand.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Got this for our one year old nephew and he really enjoys it. His dad said it was easy to assemble.  Happy with purchase.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Otherwise just buy it there to cut out the extra steps imo. Great game, very different from the first two but still maintains the art style and playability of them (smoother combat as well).	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Swaddled my baby for 3 months in these, they worked great! Once she was too old to be swaddled anymore, I still wrap them around her lower half with her arms free as a blanket. Great buy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was a gift and was a great addition to the other Xbox games my son has.  He really enjoyed the character	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Terrific graphics.  CryEngine 3 technology is the best around today.If you liked the original Sniper Ghost Warrior, you'll love this one.  It's a big step onward and upward in shooter games.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We love these disposable bibs! They are so convenient for travel or when you are out and about. Just throw  it away when you're done!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I bought this game from Walmart today. The Wii U version was great, so of course I HAD to get the 3DS one. It's a great game so far! I recommend this to everyone. I don't play a lot of Lego games, but I'm lad I decided to play this one!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This thing is crap. I'm a sucker for buying it but trust me, I didn't even think to use it. It is cheap, flimsy, and smells like chemicals, this is a dont buy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The quality of these wooden birds is fabulous. Very well made and the colors are very bright. Kids loved them and the birds look so cute.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It was worth the wait! If you are a fan you will need to get your hands on this Godzilla!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Very fun 1 or 2 player game, Also very addicting, this has been one of my favorite games for a while.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We got this for our newborn.  He is now 5 months old and this thing has held up beautifully.  We have only changed the pad at the bottom once.  I love this warmer.  I have bought it for 5 other expectant moms!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We bought these for our seven year old, they are his most loved toy.  You can make so many things from them and its really neat to see his creativity flourish.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My baby was not able to suck anything out of the mesh and the whole thing was too big to put or keep in her mouth.  We never used this product as anything more than a toy that our baby would occasionally hold and then toss away.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son loves instruments and this one didn't disappoint.  It has a great sound and the mallets are really nice too.  I plan to buy more instruments from this line.  Good quality as well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Easily one of the best console controllers ever created. I own about 6 and they all work like a dream. (A few that were several years old have finally started wearing out, not surprising considering what I&#8217;ve don&#8217;t to them over the years. Ha-ha	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought this for my 3 years old nephew and he loved it!Even my own kid, 22 months old, loved it. It is easy and sturdy. Of course, you have to be careful not to loose the parts, but it really helps them develop their sense of putting stuff together.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the official Nintendo SP charger - no more no less.  Not a cheap knockoff and will charge your SP!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We got this for our daughter to help with her fine motor skills, sorting, counting, and colors. She loves to make new kinds of pies, and play games with this!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My kids cant get enough of the sneaky little squirrel. They ask to play it everyday. How do they not get tired? I even bought one as a birthday gift, and his mom told me that it was also a great success wi her three year old.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
LEAKS! LEAKS! LEAKS! LEAKS! I JUST LIKE THE HANDLES ON THE CUP BUT NOT A GOOD CUP BECAUSE IT LEAKS.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Battery like is great, and the sound is very good. I will suggest a volume for future products. Besides that, is perfect	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is high quality and with both the girl and the boy it keeps both my little niece and my little nephews interested in playing.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I know these aren't the name brand cloth diapers, but they are quality made I think and great absorbancy. They wash well and fit my child great. They have an over lapping feature for small children too. I only use alva diapers bc they are affordable and they do the job.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great FPS game.  Fun to play and a large on-line community.  Action packed, hours of fun guaranteed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I really like this but it does not fit my graco day to night pack n play well. it makes the middle bunch up a bit.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
my 8 year old daughter is a fan of polly pockets! this ship is cute & cleaver! i love the fact that it folds up for easy storage!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We bought this as a base for a second car.  Fit our Safety 1st onBoard 35 Air car seat perfectly.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Easy to install and does exactly what is stated!  It was even difficult for my in-laws to figure out until I told them the trick!  I have to say the spring holding the cover in place is very strong, thus little fingers will have an almost impossible time to open them up.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son got these for Christmas and he LOVED them!  The pack had some really nice cars in it and he plays with them every day.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I like this product due to the grafics and the cars. If you like the oldies like I do then you may like the music too.I would recomend it to almost anyone, especially if you like the driver games.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the BEST Farkel game for the money.  I love the various colored dice cubes - and the cups are neat, too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So nice to have lego sets for girls!  Gave this as a birthday gift for a 6 year old and she loves it.  We like the Lego quality and the price was good too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a good value for 50 Hot Wheels cars.  There is a good variety in one box.  The box is cardboard and isn't really meant for long term storage of cars that will be played with.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
1>campaign compare to past COD?  graphics is ok, but storyline is a meh2>multiplayer? they removed NukeTown playlist and hasn't show up in normal rotation yet.  so NukeTown dlc is only valid for one week?  that is a false ads scam3>Elite not working, another false ads scamActivision SHAME on you.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are great. Easy for my daughter to suck and chew on. I froze them with chamomile tea for my daughter who is teething.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is TERRIBLE - as a previous poster mentioned, it does not recognize a great many common words.  If I could have given it zero stars, I would have, because it's not worth even one. :-p	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My baby loves these, more than every other toy she has. They are easy to transport, cheap, and easy to wash. Definitely the best toy purchase we have made. She has played with them since she was 2 months old and at 6 months they are still her favorite. Don't get the Fisher Price ones, these are the best.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Purchased for my 8 year old Scooby fan. She carts it everywhere and it holds up nicely. Occasionally dognapped by my 3 year old, he has no tears and doesn't lose shape. Good quality stuffed animal.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is one of the worst games i have EVER played, maybe the worst.  even in really terrible games, i can usually find something good to say about it, but this one fails on EVERY single level.  play the demo before buying.  if you enjoy it, you have mental problems.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while I go to work.  It also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need.  I couldn't be happier with this book.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The top RTS from Ensemble Studios...with the two expansion packs that upgrade the gaming experience. If you loved Age of Empire I or II, can't skip it. For collectors & newbies!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Fits all the barbies my daughter has. I love the price and the quality of some are really good! Some not so much but I like it! My daughter love it too so I'm more than happy with my purchase!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Simple and functional. And they're not too long that I'm not worried about my baby getting tangled up in the straps. But I noticed that my baby gets frustrated when the toy doesn't fall to the floor when he throws it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Yes, there are is very large final act, 2 additional characters you can play,more great soundtracks, though likely the best features are a) the feeling of completion and story consistency once Bhaal is defeated b) the synergies introduced in the skill set system.Must have together with D1 and D2.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The assembly of the kitchen was time consuming, but the instructions were very clear and the parts easy to identify.Once assembled, the kitchen proved to be quite sturdy, and held together nicely while being moved. We gave this to our daughter for Christmas, and once she saw it, she immediately forgot there was a tree with presents wrapped underneath it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Purchased this as a secondary crib for &#34;Grandma's House&#34;. It was so easy to put together, looks beautiful, and the price was fantastic! Very sturdy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This drone is very fun and super duarable. Its very easy to use and the kids love it. I definetly recommend it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Super cute and comfy kneeler! Makes the awkwardness of bending over the tub a little less awkward. Super comfy kneeler!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Everyone loves to play this.  Great family game while learning a bot of geography as a bonus. wish they made the cards big again.. this comes with the tiny cards.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I really like this diaper, and definitely recommend it. It dries quickly too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The tray falls off as soon as my son moved around in the seat.  The whole thing is just really poorly designed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The logging truck only comes with 3 logs.  This make it so the truck has a fuller load.  Bruder makes great trucks;	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
So much easier to get this online rather than trying the local store.  This has more colors than other sets.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Simply Perfect. Since this device was targeted for kids, it's a little uncomfortable for grown-ups to play for a while without getting burning and joint pain in their hands, thats why you really neeed to browse Amazon.com for a set of grip extenders and add 'em to your cart along with the sp.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is just so SOFT... it is perfect! I admired their softness for 5 minutes once i got them.. couldn't believe how great this material is!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I enjoyed this game and was ready to play it once I completed the first Ninja Gaiden. This game did not disappoint.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Love this toy because if offers a variety of activities for my grandson to do. He can push panels and it makes noises like counting, abc's , and sings music. All the things he loves.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love this game. There is no violence or offensive language and it encourages creativity. The price was awesome too!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Precious! She loves it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are a great product for travel in the car.  Very nice complement to the Bumkins bibs, which we also use on travel (stopping at rest stops, etc.)  Keeps snacks and sandwiches protected and available.  Can be on their own in the tote bag.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Well you can't play without dice.  I find the Translucent Dice to be far more aesthetically pleasing while role playing.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
perfect for my 3 year old. love the belt guide so the seat belt sits perfectly on his chest.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was the perfect toy sword to go with my four year old son's Halloween costume.  It was also great to take to WDW where he wasn't asking for the other light up toys.  He loved the sounds and the lights were bright and colorful!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Get some ear plugs ready! No matter how you connect it, it will make music! My 3.5 yr old can make it work. She loves it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought these for my daughter and she loved them. They break less than some of the others we have ordered. I would recommend these.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
a great game, despite having left long stays and looks good, the wait time was short and it was worth it to say.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
and that's a mistake. I don't care if you liked or loved every other AC. This one is the ultimate pirate edition. I could spend hours on the high seas without ever leaving my ship and still be content.Get this now.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Suction cups work well, allows good drainage. Easy for my toddler to independently put her toys away. Can't beat this for the price. Only possible drawback is that bath crayons tend to slip out. We bought the Alex tub crayon holder for that.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The one-and-only Command & Conquer RTS bundle extravaganza is great. Can't get enough of the Red Alert and Tiberian Sun series'.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My daughter is 11 and doesn't play many video games.  she can play this on her own and stay occupied for a bit without getting frustrated because it is too difficult as she does with other games.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
You'll never find a cuter mini doll house with keys and buzzers from a bygone era such as this! It reminds me of the dollhouses my grandfather used to make. I absolutely love it, and for the quality and the price, it's a keeper AND a keepsake.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Little boy was so happy to get the three blues on Christmas morning. They are now scattered about the bedroom. Oh well. That's kid for you. But they are cute lil things, that came soft and well packaged.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son LOVES these little guys, and he is 7 now. He got this for his birthday, and wanted to play with them. He has a great time, and wants me to get him some more. All in due time. Would recommend to others who like these little figures mixed with Angry birds.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My daughter received this as a gift when she was 11 months. A year later and she HAS to have it for her naptime and bedtime. She loves to go to sleep to music and the light is enough to comfort her in the dark. I like the fact that the music plays a while before shutting off automatically.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
you can hang ANYTHING and EVERYTHING on these!!!! AMAZING. Love how you can rotate them too so if a bag is hitting your leg you can move it unlike the other clips that can't be rotated.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Nervous Brickdown is an awesome revisiting of retro Breakout-style gameplay, wrapped in a much prettier and more innovative package, with many cool worlds to unlock.  Highly recommended for those of us who are older gamers!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is my first Ninja Gaiden game and man is it hard.I've never played the other 2 (but i did play the original on NES)that aside, this game has nice graphics, the body parts physics are beautiful. there are alot of repetitive lines.ALOT of &#34;#$%& You!&#34;Which throws me off a bit but its still a great game and great story.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Had a hankering for nostalgic games but no controllers (in storage)...So I bought these babies for game play~ and they work very well! And it is a nice price for two.. usually at Gamestop one is like 25-30 dollars so I think it is a good deal.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
God of War Collection - PlayStation Vita is a hot and great game for the PS vita. I really like it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
HAD THIS GAME BEFORE AND LIKED IT THEN TRADED IT IN AND BOUGHT IT AGAIN NOW I HATE THE GAME	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I really like the idea of these spoons; however, they are clearly meant for right-handed children. Frankly, I'm surprised that Sassy doesn't make a version for lefties. Apart from the design flaw, the spoons are well constructed and cute.  If your child is right-handed, I would definitely recommend giving these a try, if not, don't bother.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
INCREDIBLE. This game is simply the best racing game i have ever played in my life, after playing Forza 2,3,4, & Horizon, as well as Gran Turismo 3,4,5. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves cars, or just that loves to drive fast!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Loved this game growing up, playing it with my young children (now adults) and continue enjoying playing this game with family and friends.  This is an excellent game for all ages even those who do not games!  Definitely a keeper!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son can not stop playing with this plush. He has a blast playing Mario and Sonic games on the Wii. Awesome!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Folds up small. Easy to store and very sturdy. Perfect for sitting next to the tub or anywhere else. Great product for the price.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
THis is poorly made.  It should be better given the price.  It fell apart not long after we got it...really fell apart.  Pieces of wood came loose and my child was able to get hold of the tiny screws that were used to make this.  there are better toy pianos on the market.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
