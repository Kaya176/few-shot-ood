wrong pattern they shipped to me and not helping for return back the money! packing very badly! The after sales service extremely a nightmare!	1
The description says that this is designed to work on Vista or Cruz strollers and yes, it can be used on Vista but when closing the stroller, it will hit the back wheel. This issue will cause these holders to break off and bend the frame over time.	1
The brush is poor quality.  It has a strong plastic odor and the brush bends too easily when used to clean bottles.  Given the smell and lack of labeling, I am concerned that the brush maycontain compounds that I try to avoid, like phthlate containing PVC, etc.	1
This is the worst product!  Food gets stuck and if I press it a little harder it squirts out everywhere!  Also, if you have food in there, it leaks in your bag!  I hate this!  Don't buy!	1
I was so excited to try this product given all of the great reviews. We have very hard water in our area and our towels smell the second they get wet. I couldn't wait to try this detergent but I have not noticed one teensy ounce of improvement in our towels. Too bad.	1
Highly recommend them!  I had used them for a year and a half and just bought more for next baby, they work great!	1
I bought a set just to try them out. I personally didn't prefer them. I thought it was easier to freeze the purees in ice trays and transfer them to freezer zip locks. Saves money and if you travel you can just use a regular mini Rubbermaid container.	1
I wasn't too happy with this product and ending up sending it back. The toys seemed cheap and the cost of the &#34;set&#34; was actually not terribly competitive when buying similar toys individually.	1
This thing lost a rivet/connector and broke the very first time we used it so we sent it back and didn't get another one.  Didn't really seem that durable.  Then again our kids are pros are destroying things made for kids so it might be fine for little sissies.	1
This product is horrible!  The first one I ordered lasted a week, the replacement two weeks. Before anyone comments I was very careful with water/moisture on the heating element. Great concept, horrible product.	1
I ordered this for our early teether thinking that maybe he could put it his mouth and would help his teeth and gums.  However upon recieving ..this thing is massive what baby could get this in their mouth?  I did not open and will be returning ASAP wast of money.	1
I loved this travel crib until we went to the beach and it started to grow mold underneath it. So disappointed as I spent a lot of money to make sure my child would be safe. We threw it away!	1
This is disappointing. I could take a pool noodle, cut it and make the same thing. It is incredibly cheap feeling and my child can pull on it which causes it to tear. Would not recommended this one.	1
The suction cup works great.  Reflective, so others can see it.  It really gives me an excuse to drive gently, without making the person behind me wonder what is wrong with me.This broke off at the suction cup the fifth time I used it.	1
Bought this product for my granddaughters highchair, but her chair is an older model and sadly did not fit it.	1
I hate this crib mobile attachment clamp. As my title suggests, it is way too short. Unless your mobile is one inch long, it will hang dangerously close to your baby. The clamp is very weak and can be moved easily. A cheap, terrible product.	1
This is made in china unlike all of the other Dr. Brown products I have purchased. I love Dr. Browns, but I will not be ordering anything else from them. The product page on Amazon should list where things are made.	1
I tried installing this on two strollers and it just slipped and fell off of both. I tightened it to as tight as I could make it and it just kept failing. Water ... all ... over.	1
These outlet covers are dome shaped, making them easy to grasp. There is a cutout feature in the center to make it easier for adults to get them out.That is a joke as my under one year old can just take them out and just hand them to me!Do not purchase this item, it is unsafe.	1
It was definitely tough to put together but you can expect this with most cribs. The wood seems unfinished in some areas and it was just painted over. The white paint highlights the cracks and imperfections and makes me wonder if it is safe for when the baby begins to chew on everything.	1
This product sucks.  Better off using the old-fashion aspirator you get &#34;free&#34; from the hospital.  A pain to clean and air too.	1
Way too small. It's too short for my 3 month old and doesn't cover his bum. We Tried to use it as a regular towel for a newborn and it wouldn't even wrap around without using the arms. It also stains really easy.	1
Hmm,  the liners are thin.  I'm not sure how they are helpful.  I have just been using them to wipe spit up and to clean my baby's bottom.	1
Not needed imo. You can hang your diaper bag from its own strap or store the bag underneath your stroller. The velcro is much to short to reach around our current stroller.	1
I was disappointed to pay for a "baby" version of an ice cube tray to find out the food gets freezer burn and doesn't pop out easily. I suggest getting basic ice cube tray and covering w/foil once frozen pop out and store in a freezer safe bag or tupperware. Wouldn't recommend this product.	1
I searched for a gate that met all of our needs and was safe.  I decided to purchase this one despite the cost.  When it came, it was GREEN, not brown.  So disgusting.  I returned it and got the all silver one (at a lower price) and it has been great.	1
A lot of the pins were broken had to go to store to buy more pins cause so many of them were broken into halfs	1
I wanted to like this so badly.  Even when the lid is closed, if the bottom so much as tips over, as soon as you bring it back to vertical, the content leak out.  Very disappointing.	1
This version of this product is garbage.  The broad &#34;sippy cup&#34; version leaks like a sieve.  Dont waste you money, just get the one that looks like the &#34;straw version&#34;  as those have never leaked.  We bought this on accident because we werent paying attention to the sippy style.	1
It's bulky and gets caught on everything even when I have it in a picket, which makes the clip redundant.  As for the clip.  Doesn't keep the container on. It's constantly coming off. Last but not least, the bag container latch NEVER stays closed.  It's VERY annoying.  I don't use it anymore.	1
Tiny tiny tiny. No clue what type of handle this is meant to cover. Would love to know. Clearly it's only meant for specific things. Sad.	1
No, I wouldn't recommend this product. After washing about 3 bottles a day for a couple weeks, the brush started to bend at the base until it was so flimsy that it broke in half.	1
This diaper leaks! i'm ready to throw it in the garbage but can't bring myself to do it since I spent money on it. No matter how I snap it or stuff it I always end up changing an outfit after my baby wears it. Don't be tempted by the cheaper cost, spend more and get something that works!	1
My son would try to move his arms up and out of it and get stuck in uncomfortable positions. Also, in the process of trying to move his arms out, the swaddle would come up to his face and nose (which could cause suffocation). I never used these - waste of money!	1
This was a nice idea, but my child took it off very easily no matter what I did to get it to stay on.	1
Purchased this for our Prius. It worked really great until it stopped working. Not really sure what happened, it was a hot day so maybe that had something to do with it. We kept trying to put it back up but after a few minutes it would just fall down again.	1
We bought this for our newest and one of the monitors quit working w/in the first 90 days of use. We lost the second monitor when she was about 8 months old.  Pick another model and/or brand if you want something that is going to see you through at least the first year of having your little one.	1
This car seat was put on the "do not buy" list by the Institute of Highway Safety in November 2013.  It failed safety tests because of the placement of the belts (too high on the abdomen and too far out on the shoulder).	1
This set is cheaper in person that it looks online.  Do not waste your money.  The handles broke after the second use for both items.	1
the bottles came in envelope, no packege no nothing.looks like used :(((shame on you!! these are related to breastfeeding, should be sealed and sterile	1
These spoons are thin and flimsy and very small. I like the fact they are American made and safe, but they are just too small and lightweight, so I replaced them with the Green Toys spoons and forks, which I also reviewed.	1
My least favorite diaper out of bum genius and thirsties. On smallest setting, left a huge gap around legs. Fit oddly so never really used. Definitely smaller than any of my other diapers. Pretty colors.	1
That's it.  Title says it all.  They leak and if they can't hold the milk they are useless to us.  Leak if from the bottom when I defrost in the frig.  Just cleaned up breast milk off the frig shelf.  Now my little one has no milk for today :(	1
I bought two. Threw them both away after cutting the pacifier off. So I got a pacifier for 12 bucks	1
This is nothing more than a piece of fabric with 2 holes cut out and a zipper added...there is no support, no stretch, no straps. I know it would have been too stretched out to use after one or 2 uses. Returned it. Not worth the $...save time and spend the extra $10 for the Simple Wishes one	1
I was hoping this would be a good intermediate between a sippy cup and a real cup but you might as well just use a regular cup.  Basically the holes don't do much good and my daughter just dumps water all over herself.  I haven;t found another cup that works better but this one isn't very good.	1
I'm very sensitive to smells and I can't smell these. I wonder if mine are broken or old. -1 star if I could.	1
It's cute and slender, but the lid didn't close tightly, so the wipes would dry out quickly. Disappointed, I returned it immediately.	1
These seemed like a great idea, but unfortunately the lids do not click on at all! They were not put in the dishwasher and have never even been used...just hand washed.	1
The smell of plastic was so strong on this item that I threw it in the garbage.  There was NO way I would let my teething baby boy put it in his mouth!	1
Didn't like the fabric, is very thin and does not absorb anything. I do not recommend it. Pay a little more and buy something that really works.	1
it is alot bigger than what u see in the picture! the sticker dont really work and it keep dropping when somebody pass by and we have to use a staple gun to fix it. Oh by the way, take forever to get here..	1
this product doesn't do what it supposed to. the pacifier is bigger and havier than the toy's head so it falls down, the toy is useless.so expensive.waste of money	1
this product did not meet my expectations, the tie strings were too short and overall it was a bad design for my crib. i found a design to make my own on pintrest after i purchased this.  i would suggest buying some fabric and making your own.	1
Icy blue tails were too large for toddler mouth or even adult mouths.  It was too bulky and uncomfortable because of the enormous size of the fish tails, especially for back teeth.	1
Same complaint as everyone else. The tape doesn't stay stuck for long. I figured that this must be some super powerful adhesive, but no. Spit would work almost as well.	1
I wanted to use these just from my upstairs to downstairs, bedrooms are really close. You can not hear anything and it crackles all the time.  Buy something better. You get what you pay for.	1
This is a nice and large; however, it does not stay on the wall, especially when it's filled with a lot of wet toys. I was very disappointed.	1
My son tore these off the corners of our walls almost immediately and the glue took the paint right off the walls. These are great if your baby is not walking or doesn't have the strength to tear them off the walls.	1
This is an absolute waste of money. It does say that it plays for 21/2 minutes but then to wind it up is very noisy and so distracts a baby who is being soothed. My son didn't like it anyway. Tiny Love is a better buy. Glad this was a gift and I didn't spend my money!	1
The neck support did not support my baby's neck while in the car seat. The baby's head was still tilted.	1
It says no drill, but there were screws with it... You still have to screw something in your cabinet to install this. Which I can't do because our rent house has some kind of plastic cabinets. The sticker things are not meant to permanently hold it in place, just to hold it while you screw it in.	1
I bought this monitor for my in-laws because it used the same technology as my current monitors that I love, but was less expensive. However they keep disconnecting and are horrible. I returned them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone!	1
We thought the HALO SleepSack would be the perfect solution to our baby's swaddling struggles. However over the course a night full of kicking, it rides up dangerously close to covering our baby's mouth affecting her ability to breathe. I would NOT recommend the HALO SleepSack, we have found much more success with the woombie.	1
These are not very absorbent and they smelled so bad after a couple uses.  I hate that they're filled with polyester instead of more cotton.	1
They became malformed and wonky after the first use. Closer inspection revealed these &#34;bath toys&#34; come with a tag noting they can't be submerged in water. Ridiculous.	1
Useless as the little rubber section will split and loses ability to hold door.  Before it splits, works great and our 2 yr old was unable to get the door open during naps.  We bought 2 thinking that we may have gotten a bad one the first time.  Happened faster with the second.  Wouldn't recommend.	1
This is a pain to use.  I would save up gift cards, or make sure you put an electric pump on your registry.  This isn't going to get the job done for you.	1
Really depends on each individual baby.  My personal experience was that she couldn't keep these in her mouth.  Similar to the Soothie style pacifier which she also finds difficult to hold on to.  For her, the Nuk is the best.It really is personal preference.	1
Unfortunately, these do not adhere to our windows at all. Car is a Matrix. This is a case where the price is too good to be true.	1
If your breasts are sore, the last thing you want is this thing wrapped around you.  Just skip it and you warm towels.	1
Doesn't fit Diaper Genie classic, don't waste your money. It's too big and the lid falls off almost every time, which defeats the point of keeping the smell IN the diaper genie.	1
Cute idea, however, one of my rattles didn't rattle. Not that they rattled much to begin with. By the time I would have received a replacement through Amazon he would have out grown them so it's hard to say weather or not the wrist rattles would have worked for my little guy. Returned and refunded.	1
to small, and uncomfortable, and it was unsafe, i bought too early, when my boy was borned it was 6 months later. so i don't return it, and just wast money	1
I don't know if my house is the problem but even with this stepping stool my almost 2 year old can't reach the sink.	1
The opening is wayyyy to small for a hand to fit in ..and it is not stretchy... These did not fit my LO	1
This product does not fit the Britax B-Safe car seat.  The belts don't fit properly within the slots of the piddle pad, and the large opening for the buckle could easily allow fluid to get through.  Really disappointed with this purchase.	1
Thought they would be bigger. They were really small and would not stay on the furniture. I was quite disappointed.	1
This toy organizer was WONDERFUL while it worked! I had it for four months and it never fell, not even when my daughter pulled on it. However now it has stopped working, it won't stick on the smooth tile not the glass door. I have cleaned it, placed pressure, avoided it getting wet...etc... nothing has worked.	1
These doublers are horrible! Not worth wasting the money on these. I got these mainly for the price, but these just didn't work for us and don't last as an overnight solution. I should of just paid a little more money and got something better. Try at your own risk. LOL.	1
The adhesive detaches from the drawer or from the strap itself.  I have reattached the strap with 3m poster adhesive strips with some success. It's so aggravating when I look over and see my toddler going thru a drawer that I carefully &#34;secured&#34; with the straps that have defective adhesive that has detached from the strap!!!!!	1
This does not stick on my bathroom tile either. I am pretty sure my tile is untextured. I have tried everything and cannot get it to stick. I am trying to find a way to rig it up now so I can use it.	1
The package clearly says &#34;for girls&#34;.  That should've been in the product description!  Waste of time, now I have to return.Why notT make gender neutral, btw?	1
The material is elastic like and the snaps are cheap/ hard. The diaper was a cheap fit. I prefer my softbums and rumparooz to this cheap Chinese diaper. I got rid of it in the third try.I have almost all the other diaper brands and this one was a waste!	1
it is only a sheet with very soft cover not for all playards and not like a fitted sheet i imagine	1
We bought these to use for our 7 month old when we went on vacation last month.  They were pretty much useless to us.  The baby was able to rip them right off her neck as soon as we put them on her.  Now we have a box of worthless, half used bibs sitting in our closet.	1
It's not well made and if you have a heavy child.  I would not recommend this booster seat for anyone.  Not worth your money you are better off holding your child on your lap.	1
I tried to put him on the tile to breathe, do not know why it fell off a while, tried many times will not work, very depressed, the key is to put a bath in a few blue floating toys. . .	1
You would have to have an absolutely still baby and super deft hands in order to use these without risking it fly up their nose. I would not recommend this for use on a baby.	1
The concept of this gate is good but is lacking in design execution. Our cat would never crawl through the hole and it is kinda flimsy and not as sturdy as I expect a baby gate to be.	1
I bought this after purchasing the Bugaboo Donkey but unfortunately it does not sit right on the handles. It flops down & is very cumbersome. I wish I still had to packaging to return it because we don't use it at all. Just attach your diaper bag & use the pockets in that because this doesn't sit right at all.	1
If you are using Dr. Brown's long bottles, this is NOT the sterilizer for you.  And for other bottles, you have to be really patient to work with the adjustable middle racks.  This thing frustrates me to no end, I can't wait to get another one.  This was a baby shower gift.	1
We got this as a gift.  The back wheels came off within a few days.  This product is so poorly made, Kolcraft ought to be embarrassed.  Just a disgrace.  The toys on the tray are boring too.  Just a bad product all around.	1
The tether could be longer it was pretty much unusable for me because it was so short. The clip was nice but that was the only plus	1
this does not make much rattle sound. i was very disappointed, and used it as a useless toy. dont buy it if you are looking for a fun toy.	1
This bath tub will leak.  It won't matter whether you use it correctly and snap close the 2 pieces.  When it is full of water, the weight of the water will bend the plastic body (especially when I lift the tub to and from the bathroom floor to faucet).	1
I liked the matching oxo design, the stand with the water spout, and the color was smart, but the bristle is too soft on this brush. I bought a munchkin and kept the stand.	1
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not order this product if you have a 36&#34; door.  You WILL be disappointed.  It is approx 1/4&#34; - 1/2&#34; too narrow.  I am returning to Amazon as we speak.  Read the other reviews, you will see others have had the same issue.	1
This stained my new bumgenius elemental diapers.  I would not recommend to anyone.  Coconut oil works just as good as doesn't stain and is super cheap.  Don't buy!	1
I bought a case of these wipes without previously using them. What a huge regret! I've now tried them several times and they always cause a diaper rash. I recommend pampers sensitive or burts bees. I hate these wipes!	1
this is the lightest bag ive ever had. i have so many diaper bags and all of them are so heavy when i out all my kids stuff. this one is so light even if im carrying my daughter on other shoulder.	2
My daughter loves this thing.  There is a lot of bright, patterned, flashy things that play music when she bumps them.  She spins from section to section playing with the different pieces just smiling as big as she can.The construction seems very sturdy and I expect this to last quite a while.	2
I love that this mirror has adjustable straps which were easy to adjust. I bought a second mirror for my husband's car, too.	2
We have a new born son at 37 weeks, so we needed the small ones. I ordered the yellow color, we got pink instead.Luckily a friend is pregnant with a girl. I shall order another set and hopefully we get the right color this time.	2
Great hamper. The top fits snuggly and there are little springy bars inside that keep the flip top rigid so that it holds its shape. Made with the same great OXO quality that I would expect.	2
Our 2 1/2 year old daughter cannot figure these out! Love them! Perfect for our medicine cabinet and household cleaning cabinet as well.	2
This rain cover does not smell have that awful cheap plastic smell. It's very simply to install and goes perfectly with my blue and lime green iCandy Peach stroller. It keeps my little guy dry when it rains and protects him from the wind.Highly recommended.	2
I mostly bought my daughter glass bottles because I do not want the free radicals that are released from plastic to get into her milk. I feel slightly like I've negated the renewable resource aspect of glass, though, by purchasing silicone.	2
Love these wraps. They work really well with any inserts and are nice and trim. Usually just fold a prefold and lay it wrap and go! Nice and fast and stays on well.	2
I am not sure why people complain about thie mat. It works just fine with our bathtub and i had no issues with it.	2
My daughter LOVES this mat.  She started using it at 7 weeks and really likes the piano for kicking.  The toys are easy for her to bat at and she LOVES to look at herself in the mirror.	2
Thank goodness for soft rattles! Our daughter is sadly somewhat clumsy like me and fortunately she can play with this toy without worry! Bright colors, matches the stroller giraffe. Would recommend.	2
This item is adorable. A little bit small, but perfect for bringing it everywhere or leaving it in the diaper bag. I liked it because it was machine washable and seems to be holding up well against my daughter's use and regular cleanings.	2
Great cup for my 2 year old. She's ready for a regular cup but mom isn't quite ready, sense she has a 8 month old sister who pulls her cup off the table. This lets my daughter think she's got a big cup but with NO leaks! Amazing cup! Cute as well, highly recommend! A great buy!	2
Awesome carseat that allows for extended rear facing and my toddler seems to think it's super comfortable. My only problem is the price, but it's worth it. The cup holder doesn't stay in well and the cover isn't super easy to get on/off to wash (typical of car seats from what I've seen).	2
I really like these bottles, the sipper spout is easy for my baby to drink out of. My only complaint is that they are a little long for him now at 10 months. He cant hold it well and tip back his head. For now I put the sipper spout from this bottle on the 5 oz bottle.	2
I tried three to beign with and ahve since changed over all my bottles to Tommee Tippee.  My little one loves them, and they work well	2
No complaints, great car seat. It is VERY large, but it has a very high safety rating, and that's all that counts.	2
This clip stays on very well. We have tried several other clips so far, he could yank off every one. So far with several days of use he has not been able to yank it off.	2
I really like the PW wetbags. The are thick and no odors seem to escape. Able to fit plenty of dipes but I wish it was easier to open with one hand. Great buy though!	2
We have a toddler who had a growth spurt which didn't translate to his middle (thank goodness!). We had to go up a size in clothes which means that the length is now correct but the waist is too big. This little belt does the trick!	2
When it's first put on the 3&#34; foam mattress it's tight but once it's on and gets worked in it's great!	2
Love these bags for on the go. Bought the clip to attach to the diaper bag. A must for all diaper bags.	2
We have wooden blocks, but they have SHARP edges... these are much, MUCH better and the twins both love playing with them. Our pediatrician says it's good for their development to simply knock them down... I build back up, they knock back down. Who would have guessed? But the babies enjoy them.	2
I love these paci clips and use them nearly every day.  They keep my son's paci off the floor and stayed clipped on really well.	2
We use these for our daughter every night. We have been using them for 8 months. We wash them weekly and the fabric has held up just fine.I really like the hood for her head after I wash her hair.Very good product.	2
Awesome for cleaning bottles and baby items on the go. Will take this with me everywhere as it is so handy.	2
It works great but it is a little small for my sons head but he is 18 months so it may be made for smaller children. I use it on my son when he wants to play in the tub while I shower. It works great but he is about to grow out of it.	2
I had to use these from the beginning with my baby that the whole born Free line is really good qualityI will tell you that the glass bottles are a little bit heavy but they're really nice. Easy to clean too!	2
This is a great size for my garden tub but doesn't fit in my regular tub. It has enough room for her to play and it cleans well too.	2
I buy it for my little baby, the appearance is very cute and easy to grasp. Hope my baby loves it too.	2
We don't use the monitor much, but every once in awhile if we want to go outside.  Has a great range on it and love that I plug in both monitors and not eat up the batteries!	2
The bag makes keeping puke filled infant clothes separate from everything else in the baby bag. Pretty darn useful. Somehow we never remember to bring it though:-)	2
my little girl (7 months then) loves this. it rattles and she eats them like they are so delicious.	2
We liked this toy so much that we bought one for a secret Santa gift for the angel tree at church.  My daughter just loves the activities on this table, even though she can't stand to play with it yet.  Baby Einstein products are the best.	2
I used this to make a diaper tractor & it was perfect for the shower.  The color was a little more orange than red but it wasn't enough to worry about.  It was a nice shower gift for the mom too.  She was excited to get it.	2
I love Bumkins bibs, they are the only bibs that we use in our house. Although I love them to death I have never been a fan of the patterns on them until now. I am absolutely loving the Monsters Inc bibs!	2
Had these since 2010.  Used by 2 kids.  Great spoons.  Wet food stick in spoon.  Easy for child to hold and feed themselves.	2
This blanket it so soft and the colors on it are really bright and pop out at you. This is probably one of my favorite blankets I have for my baby :)	2
This zippered wet bag works well. The size is larger than my other wet bags, which is helpful. Cute design.	2
Easy to install and do the job well. No more red rub marks on the kid's necks. Really good value.	2
I love this, we travel a lot and it fits in my pumping bag easily with 2 set ups of pumping equipment/bottles and do e microwave sterile bags. wish I had it with my first as well.	2
Great cover for large plugs - use for my daughters monitor so that she can't pull it out of of the wall and turn off her monitor.	2
My daughter as severe reflux, so bibs are a wardrobe necessity for us. We go through several bibs in one day. I love these bibs because they are absorbant and very soft. I also love the side snap that can be adjusted as baby grows. I highly recommend them to all my mommy friends.	2
We only use Dr. Brown's bottles for our babies & they are great.  Less spit up & gas.  Great product.	2
The level 3 nipple was too fast for my 7 month old. We switched back to Level 2 for now. We have been using Dr. Brown nipples for our son since he was born to feed him pumped milk at night. He has always liked the Dr. Brown bottles and nipples but was not ready yet for this fast flow.	2
Very nice and soft. We are using it to clean our baby's mouth after eating. We use another set of this cloth as our baby's wash cloth. Works perfectly for both purposes.	2
It's super comfortable and pretty.  I would highly recommend this product.  It also does not bunch up and fits comfortably in any bra.	2
This bag is sturdy and just the right size. We can stuff about 15-16 bumgenius style diapers in here. Then we zip it up and carry it to the washer, where we empty it and wash it with the diapers. We hang it up on our closet doorknob. Really a great invention!	2
I've tried a few different straw cups, and this one is the most leakproof.  It's still not perfect (you have to screw the lid on just right), but it's better than the rest.  My 11-month-old found it easy to use and still loves it several months later.	2
Good size for little hands, easy to grip, sturdy construction. Makes for a long meal watching my one year old try to stab a single kernel of corn, but I guess he has to learn some way.	2
This was exactly what I expected it to be and MORE!  My 2.5 yo loves it and requests her nibble dish!  It comes with a very handy guide and serving suggestions.  It is very easy to clean and store (although we don't store it very often since we use it every day).  Great purchase!	2
Keeps things clean and the potty off the floor.  What a great invention!  My daughter loves to hang her potty up after she's done!	2
This pad makes it easier to place my son in his car seat by holding the lower buckle up and away from him.	2
My son loves this toy, so many thing to play with an see and the colors are great. multiple toys in one!	2
This is a great night light. I think this helps keep my daughter in bed at night. It gives her something quiet to play with and she can select the color of stars she's like projected on her ceiling and walls. Great purchase and great product!	2
My daughter loves these, we had them on the bar of her rocker and now hang them over her playmat. She still loves grabbing at them. The bright colors captivate her and the rattles and crinkles catch her attention. Awesome addition to her first toys.	2
This is the neatest cup I have ever seen. It is great for a first cup, very unique and I haven't found it anywhere but on here.	2
Genius developmental toy keeps my 7 month old girl entertained, after her morning breakfast.  She spins the wheels and loves the rings on the bottom.  The suction at the bottom works really well.  Will be purchasing more as gifts for sure.	2
Good price, it was cute. Worked well and it looked good in pictures. Glad i bought this product, would recommend.	2
I love this product. My baby loves it too. Whether it is taking her to the doctor's office, grocery store, or out and about, she is a happy camper. I sometimes even wear it around the house with her facing outward so I can do my chores and keep the baby entertained. Love it.	2
I love this diaper bag so much that I continually recommend it to my friends that are expecting. :) The color and pattern are subtle enough for my husband to also carry it around!!	2
Its a good mirror that allows me to see my little girl and the back seat while i drive! :D	2
This pump is so small that its easy to take anywhere and use. And once you get used to it its easy to pump a full bottle in no time. Amazing travel size, I don't know what I would have done with out this!	2
Very nice colors, looks almost like hand made, soft fabric, perfect size bell-crow, never warned out from washing unlike others.	2
does not fall apart like other brushes. it stays sturdy in the stand and the little drain is helpful.  i don't use the little inside cleaner often, but it works ok.  can't beat this brush for the price!	2
We love this mattress! It was so affordable and the depth seems to be just right to get a really snug fit on ALL of our crib sheets. It fits our Sorelle Petite Paradise crib really well, no wiggling whatsoever. LOVE that the waterproof pad can come on and off.	2
Great item. I gave this as a baby shower gift and was told that it was a great item to have when having a new baby.	2
We have tried several kinds of panties, these are by far the best.  When she was first potty training and would have accidents and these panties would absorb a good bit of it.  In combination with cotton pants we never had to clean up the floor.  She also finds them comfortable and never gets wedgies from these.	2
I loved this for my new baby. I kept mine on the kitchen counter till he was about 4 months. Its great to have a place to set them down when you are doing a million things. Of course once they start getting mobile you can't use it but it was great to have. Get it!	2
I bought this changing pad to use downstairs with the play pen so I wouldn't have to go upstairs to the changing table constantly. It's great, on the small side and the white does get dirty, but easy to clean and store.	2
I love this product. This is all I use with my son now. I will suggest it to anyone I know who has kids or is going to have kids. They are easy to clean, effective, really do help with colic. They really are the best out of all the ones I have tried.	2
It's a fun toy for little babies and big babies!  A perfect grow with me toy and fun too. My daughter loves the songs. When we're away from it, I sing the songs to her and she loves it!	2
I use this daily. It does the job. I'm happy. Use it with my Medela PISA while I pump on the way to work.	2
My little man cannot sleep without this monster!  He calls it his MEH.  I bought two more just incase anything every happens to it.	2
We use cloth diapers and this bag is perfect for us to put our wet/dirty diapers into when we're on the go.  No smell and very cute on the outside.	2
Our Baby Boy loves these!!! He's 7 wks old and just starting to hang on to them .. These are very soft!	2
Love these! The quality and softness is as good as my A&A ones that cost 2-3 times more. My only wish us that they had these is more colors and prints so I could buy them all! They're soft, stretchy, bug and great for year round use. Definitely a must-have baby item, whether you swaddle or not.	2
These are super easy to get on and off and they even have a little pad on the bottom to absorb the liquids. Genius! We use them with the Potette Plus (Which we also love)	2
Super cute and cuddly ... the only thing is to note that there is an age range for neck sizing. I didn't realize until after I purchased. Not too big a deal but my 5 year old who is like an 8 year old size could use a bigger neck pillow. My 3 year old - it fits perfect.	2
Works well, good idea for inside diaper pail. Would recommend this product. Smells nice too. Only draw back is that you &#34; open&#34; all of the at once because of the packaging it comes in. Would have preferred to use one at a time.	2
so soft, excellent design.  theses are my favorite cloth diapers.  neutral color for boy or girl.  2 pack is a great deal.	2
This little guy packs a big punch.  Lots of features that we use often.  Good value.  Would buy again.  .	2
This is a perfect little lunch bag and it was hard to choose which cute bag to purchase too. My son loves bees, so this was easy (although I loved the puppy more :P) Very durable and encourages a little one to walk around with this very light georgeous bag.	2
love the colors.. very bright and happy. eye catching for baby. very well made. happy with my purchase.  good teaching book for a toddler.	2
i love this product. it brightens my day every time. but not only is it cute, it is very functional. it fits everything i need it to fit, with room to spare. i got 2 stems with the lawn and havent regretted it since.	2
Love it use it everywhere. At the store and when going out to eat.	2
I own two, one for the litter box and one for the diapers. Convenient, no stink, no mess. The diaper one fills up faster than we'd like, and the refills aren't cheap. But still such an awesome product I give it 5 stars. Hope in the future they will make biodegradable refills...	2
These do the job and while they do make it tougher for us as well, they keep that kids out.	2
great to use, love this better than normal spoons.so much easier and less mess when feeding.use these on my 9 month old and she has taken to them well	2
It is a small wet bag just big enough to fit 3-4 diapers. Perfect for day trips. Plus it is chic looking. Some people do not care but I am willing to pay for the antibacterial material after reading on the website of the company that owns the technology.	2
This is a great baby teether.  It helped my daughter with teething and know that this is made in the USA is even better.	2
Absolutely LOVEEEEEEEEEE this bouncer. I didn't realize at the time that it has three different settings. One for sleep (drops low to the ground), one for rest (it sits about half way up), and one for play (sitting all the way up). It's perfect!!!! Very sleek too! :)	2
I am looking forward to having this peace of mind when baby gets here.I thought about angel care mats but they had some recalls for deaths and it spooked me.So I saw a post recomending this and i tested it out simple to use hope it never goes off!	2
Goes perfectly with my nursery for my twins. It is so soft and washes easily. Even after many washes it still looks brand new.	2
Adorable story with great pictures. Love how big it is and how easy it is for my little guy to interact in it.	2
No dripping!  Easy to clean.  Hold up well to drops from our daughter.  I will defiantly get more of them.	2
We have several types of wipes we use for our cloth diapering system, but these are our favorites. they are thin but still wipe everything off nicely. I do not use them wet but instead spray my little ones bottom to make sure it doesn't &#34;stick&#34; there.	2
absolutely darling with the softest materials you can imagine.  I'm ordering another &#34;antique looking&#34; one for our house.  WOW, no more cranking.	2
These are the only pacifiers either of my sons would use, they are great!I would buy them again & again	2
My 4 year old likes to tell me that curly hair has oval follicles, this was the funniest thing she learned from the book, such a random thing for her to tell me but very cool! GREAT book.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
When the young lady in my life is happy, I am happy.  My daughter loves playing with her doctor bag.  The items are cute, with sparkles, and approximate actual doctor tools.  She loves carrying it around and has fun giving us all check-ups.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
ADULTS LIKE TO PLAY WITH THIS AS MUCH AS MY GRANDSON - SO NEAT AND EASY AND ENCOURAGES VARIOUS BODY ACTIONS SO NOT ALWAYS LAYING ON FLOOR	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Best game ever man, best game ever. It will no doubt win game of the year. You buy now. Overnight shipping.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My grandson loves Wall-E. It's a game that he plays when he goes to bed. Calms him down better than a story. And he learns at the same time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This set arrived in excellent condition and since I'm a Halo nut, I had to have the Limited Edition. The price was right also.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Really the food this makes isn't like eating at a 4 star restaurant.  BUT it's fun, fast, easy and exciting to do with any little kid.  They love to see their hard work turn into a fun treat. Easy to eat and share in tiny servings, lots of food options to try and buy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son loves this game and this was fun for family bonding and family game night. We teach him a second language so we have him speak in a different language for the colors.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I called out sick from work so that I can just keep playing this bad boy. It's that damn good.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I was impressed with this toy, for a foam piece it has held up really well to everyday play - and even when I stepped on it by accident lol.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Not only is the detail amazing as well as the pose, the translucent material painted in certain parts to be opaque is perfect for the fiery and mythical phoenix. Safari has impressed me greatly with its models as well as its fair prices.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is an amazing game. Simple to learn with a ton of replayability. Its quick so you can get several games in during an evening of play. I would recommend 4 player and up, but also works decent for 3.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I am a huge Silkk and No-Limit fan. I got this cd when it first came out and hated it. It had 2 or 3 good songs. I went back to give it another chance last night years and years later since it's release and it still sucks to me.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love that it is TALL and plush......Not unreasonably-tall, or hard-to-find-a-place-for-tall ---- but also not tuck-under-your-arm-tall.  This is a stuffed giraffe that is well balanced so it stands easily.  A good choice for ~$20.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This thing is the dopest if you want your little guy or girl to be blastin' sweet HRs in no time.  I bought this for my daughter and she immediately started going yard.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My daughter received this stroller for her second birthday, and it was hands down the favorite gift received!  It fits a 12 inch doll perfectly and several stuffed animals or another baby as well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
She's pretty and unique.  Only prob is her tail doesn't seem to stay on very well, but my 7 yr old daughter loves her	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This isn't better than the gamecube version. Nintendo really needs to step their game up. I returned this the same day I bought it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Car is very well made.  My grandston loves it.  The trunk in front holds things to take on your walk with you.The wheels are alittle noisy on concrete - but you get used to it after a few uses.  He looks forward to his carride everytime he visits his grandma.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It is a great game taking on all the best Super Heros  is the really super i love it. Col.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Multiplayer games on Xbox Live are fun until it freezes or disconnects for no reason. They should fix these things before releaesing the game. The single-player game is mediocre at best.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
SHE LIKES THIS	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Dolls with tails and accessories that are a bit different from your usual Barbie are a hit with the little girls.  This one also has a sort of semi-vampire look which they like.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have a 4yr old little boy that LOVES preschool, so I set up a little preschool in his room. He likes to use his pointers and have Me follow along when he's being the teacher in his classroom.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My triplet granddaughters love these!  They got the castle for Christmas and they each have their own princess and prince or knight.  Even the adults enjoy putting them at the tops of their ramps and watching them &#34;klip klop&#34; down.  They're just simple, cute and fun (and no batteries!)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This set was so helpful for my grand niece. Used the set all summer. Certainly more than worth the money.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

game will not install,no solutions found by company.i cant even try the game,it simply wont work,waste of money,might as well flush your money down the toilet.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great production from the Bad Boy camp. You can tell this album was heavily influenced by Dr Dre's The Chronic album. You know you have a great album when the best songs aren't the hit singles. The centerpiece of the album is "Me & My Bitch"	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are so cute. They're so smooth and really good quality. Can't wait to play with these with my daughter.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our Daughter LOVES Liv Dolls! They are so STYLISH & made well! This one is her FAV!!! They have hair you will envy! You may wish you had their clothes too! The interchangeable earrings are an added bonus!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I played it and finished.  It's a great game.  Great Graphics and great game play.  Wish I had more friends playing the online instead of Halo 3.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
If you like puzzles, this game has a ton in store.  Worth checking out if you have a 3DS!  I still haven't finished all the puzzles, and have had at least 20 hours worth of gameplay!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Waited for the price to drop down and have been worried due to some of the prior negative comments.  This is a very new and improved GT5.  It is not over the top different but it is a huge bit better.  Glad I bought it and don't see myself playing GT5 any time soon.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I gave this to my Mother in law for Christmas along with a bunch of harry potter themed candy and the kymera remote control wand.  We played all Christmas day, we were all pretty good at everything except when they mixed the letters up on a name or word, we all stunk at that.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have played all in the Breath of Fire series for the PS2 and glad I bought this game for the PSP! I am enjoying it very much. Had to buy from UK dealer and received game earlier than predicted. Very pleased with game and seller! Recommend both.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Ahoy maties!  Very cute figures.  However the body parts don't move.  Purchased these to stuff the Christmas stockings for the children.  Nice to look at but they could get lost quickly as they are very small pieces.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Very realistic looking guitar.  With proper strings will sound like a great guitar too.  Comes with cheap strings which are fine for young kids using it as a toy and not a real instrument.  Great price and well made.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Good quality, met our expectations.  Has held up well to all his Angry Birds recreations with blocks, pillows, whatever else he can find to use...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great song by Jessee J.  She is a fine singer, and this song is cheerful, and has a great beat.  I listen to it all of the time, and Jessee J. has a great singing voice, and Dominois a great song to listen to!!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Again really just came out really this much money already come on, someone is pulling someones leg about this,Find it cheaper, good luck to all, From one Transformers Fan to another these prices are crazy and this toy is so hard to find and that is just not fair	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Well this is the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played and I loved it, the graphics, the gameplay. Yes it may have some glitches but it makes up for it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I'm a mom of four and we have a closet full of game. This has become a favorite very quick. It's not only fun, but the kids learn colors and how to work together by stacking the blocks in different ways - either alone or together. It's been a great game for the entire family!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Only Wii can bring fun games like this to the table ad make good use of the Wii Zapper.  Or better yet some of the finer guns available for the Wii.  Great fun, endless possibilities.  Man vs Chicken!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Inexpensive fun. They last awhile and be sure to get one for everybody. Makes a great doy toy as well with proper supervison	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My two youngest love this toy! One just turned one and the other is three. They both love hammering away at the three light up pegs and using the drill. Everything makes sounds. They think they are like their daddy using the tools.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Game froze every time I entered "Create" mode. What can I say? I'm a creativity nut. This was even after I cleaned the disc. Let's just say, it's no wonder that there were only 2 Raw games and, altogether, 11 Smackdown games, from Smackdown 1 on PS1 through Smackdown Vs. Raw 2011 on PS2. The Smackdown series was always superior!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My grandson loves the games and especially the car chases.  He is not old enough to drive so it is ok with games to speed and drive crazy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great gift for my three year old who adores giraffes. Item arrived very quickly, in perfect brand new condition. This Dream Lite is a newer one from the original batch when they first came out. The power button is setup differently, but still works just the same.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is great fun for family to do of all ages.  I love the beats and the dances are good exercise between movements as well as their dances some are funny and make you laugh!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We travel a bunch and this is a must, we purchased this with the travel/video display case and the kids like it better than the built in DVD player in our suburban!! Charges without using the precious batteries, love this product!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It is so hard to find just a &#34;set&#34; of Legos that do not build a specific item. This is a great beginner set.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These balls are not what I thought.  They are extremely small and don't glow.  A waste of money, I was planning to use these as mardi gras throws.. very dissapointed	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I got this controller to play 2D games. The D-Pad isn't as great as I expected but it still works very well. Its sturdy, light and very comfortable. These controlers are very hard to find and most with analog sticks tend to have horrible D-Pads. Im happy with this purchase and have many hours of play time on this controller.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 3 yr old loves these puzzles, they are sturdy cardboard and the pieces fit together easily. No complaints, we love Melissa and Doug!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My toddler started showing interest in this toy shortly after he turned 2. He had some difficulty at first and needed assistance, now he is almost 2 and a half and loves it !!

Musical innovation?Some monotonous dullard talking about such interesting topics as being on Ecstacy, kebab shops and drinking lager over the usual looped beats and obligatory &quot;feelin' so high&quot; female samples.&quot;But, yeah man, he's talking 'bout the streets, ya know, the real world.&quot;Do yourself a favour and trade it in for a Doner and a can of Fanta.Hideous.

The tea bags are really small as is the tin but the kiddos in my classroom love playing with this. The real string attached to the bags make them extra fun to play with.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

My kids love this. I also bought the My Little Pony one and they are both on the same frequency so both run at the same time. Funny but a little bit irritating for little ones when they are both playing with them.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The second best console game I have ever played. My favorite was final fantasy for the NES. Of course it kinda blows now, but was ahead of it's time, much like dark souls.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Gambit looks sick and I really like the interchangeable hands and cards that come with this marvel select figure. The staff is a bit thin so don't expect to get too many cool poses with gambit holding it but other then that a must have.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great controller.  Hope more games integrate their games with it like Valve has.  So far, most games that I own work for it.  Pretty happy with the purchase.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
For a 5 year old this set is great. The sword is short so I cant see an older child liking it much. The shield is cute with a hand strap on the back and the short sword is just right for cutting off papa's legs in a dragon (papa) and worrier (my 5 year old) fight.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is really fun and reminds me of the old sim city games. A very relaxing way to spend time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I outgrow and get tired of games easily but Warcraft III Frozen Throne is the one game i still play since its original release. I can't tell you enough how fun this game is. I pretty much have all the good current games on current systems (PS3, 360, Wii) but i always come back to WC3. It's THAT good!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Saves and recovers the games as expected without any problems, I'm using it on my ps2 with ps1 games that I haven't played for the lack of a ps1 compatible memory so with this item I'm fixing that, now my ps2 is fully capable to handle ps1 games :D	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This is perfect for teaching kids about time. The hour hand cannot be moved by itself. You have to rotate the minute hand, which automatically moves the hour hand. There is also a stand in the back.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great game, as much fun as the first one. Kids like levitating cows and people and flying into signs or lakes.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

The kids haven't gotten to the point of stacking these but they enjoy knocking them down and they are very easy for them to get hold of.Update: Boys are now 1 year and just starting to get the hang of stacking these. They still like holding, chewing and banging them. Holding up well so far.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
webkins can be hard to find for a boy.  This one was perfect he not only liked the virtual world he had fun with this bat.  You can mold the wings that was a huge hit.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this toy.  She is still playing with it on December 29th.  Plays every day with it.  It is a very cute and very durable toy.  A great find and a great buy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

We all know that little ones can make a mess while creating their artwork and when that happens the Art Smock comes in handy. I am so glad I purchase this and it will be purchasing more in the future.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I simply just enjoy listening to this song.  I didn't know who Bruno Mars was until I saw him on SNL, now Im a fan.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Not as fun as I thought it would be.  More complicated than my son wanted to give the time to figure out.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Delivery time was very, very fast. Even for an international order (shipped on Sunday, got delivered on Thursday). I had the chance to play with this myself, the only downside is that apparently there are not many songs on Rock Band 3 meant for the keyboard. But I thought it's one of the coolest instruments.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It was a gift for a niece and she was very happy with it. She wanted a Barbie game for the Wii and for her age and what was offered with Barbie this was the perfect fit.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is an awesome old school videogame! Item as described and disc is in good condition! I'd recommend buying this!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
look for something better. this is pure junk, made in china so plastics are not safe and the cord is too short and thin enough to be unsafe anyway, also arrived with the paint already peeled off in some places!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These books are really great for the kids.  The colors are vibrant and the stories are sweet.  The kids always seem to enjoy them.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Got this doll for my older daughter. She loves it so much I had to get it for my younger daughter just to prevent the fights over who was going to play with it.  Pretty neat doll that can do some sweet gymnastics moves!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I constantly get compliments on the earrings and necklace. They are very well made yet are not heavy at all on your ears so you actually forget you are wearing them until someone says something.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
From 1991 to a portal through time to 2011, Classic sonic Returns from the genesis era and into excellent 3D, run, jump and collect all those rings, and jump on badniks as the Returning Classic sonic, This game is an excellent ediiton to the series and I highly suggest you buy it if your a sonic fan.

one of the best ,i liked the co-op campaign idea ,well u can't sort it as a "story" campaign coz it's kinda an objective & u have to finish them . but it's really fun to play i really liked it .	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son is a LEGO fan - loves the sets, but also loves the freedom of creating on his own.  These loose bricks give him the tools to make some awesome creations.  Highly recommended.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Even though the age says 7 to 11 my 5 year old grandaughter loves this as much as I did. As soon we started playing this we knew that we had found a great game for the family. Everyone had so much fun we forgot to put the little ones to bed.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is GORGEOUS!! It has some of the best graphics on the PSP I've ever seen!! The gameplay is fun, the music is good. It has fully voiced movie sequences. So, all-in-all it is a great game!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great sprinkler. It sprayed high and far, none of the little flowers clogged ever. They are soft rubbery plastic (I dont know what they are made of really), so that when kids run over the sprinkler, they bend over and dont hurt them. Ingenious!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
First 3ds game I bought, very well made. Haven't beaten it yet, but so far so good. Feels like a resident evil game that's for sure	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Very cute, and works great for all those little babies! My daughter loved this bed set!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Probably the best game ever created by humans. I love killin me some dinosaurs in disco mode. You have to get lost in this game to really enjoy it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Two of my children got these for Christmas to go with their Nerf Blaster gun. They love it! The discs can shoot far, so my kids like to go into a larger room to play with it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter.  I could only find it on amazon and she really wanted the duck.  She plays with it on the computer all the time. It is very soft and cute!  It came in a very timely manner and was packaged nicely.  I am very happy with this purchase.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great purchase for projects that require tracing things from originals.  It makes it easy to see where the outlines are supposed to be.  It was the best price from anywhere I looked.  It arrived in only a couple of days and in perfect condition.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a pretty good deal for the price - the tools are a good size for my 4 yr old, and he seems to have fun using them for PlayDoh.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
First as an avid gamer and MMA & boxing fan I really enjoyed this game.  Playing career mode you can design your boxer, every feature and weightclass.  The graphics are incredible.  This is a must have for even a casual combat sports fan.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a well built and very good charging station for xbox 360 controllers. It has red lights when it's charging and green lights when it's done. Very easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a charging station for 360 controllers.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

All I'm going to say is that Lost Odyssey is a harrowing journey that left me feeling completely satisfied and stirred emotionally. I miss these characters so much and think about them every day. *sniffle*	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Don't buy this game, it some how managed to get even worse then it has been in previous years. It blows my mind that EA can put this same game out every year with no improvements and charge 60 dollars for it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i give this 5 stars because it's better &#34;than the rest&#34;of hip hop's class of whenever.kendrick lamar is amazing NOW.this is great,but in just a year or two Kendrick is now the best rapper alive.this will be worth money in the future.of course it's recommended.highly.

oh this gotta be the good life OneRepublic is a good artist to listen i would recommend to listen to them!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Jill Scott knows how to sing the songs that literally make you feel at home . . . By the way can you please pass the Lemon Herbal tea while I bump these songs. Truly comfort music to my ears . . . Her music makes me FEEL beautifully human!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The wider hook is great if you have a thick bar that you are hanging these on, but I really got them because you can put doll pants on them. The hanger is still wide enough that you can put dresses and shirts on it though.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The blatantly immature, homophobic, trashy joke that is the album's title is even less funny than the old standby "Why did the chicken cross the road?", and the band itself is just as predictable. Don't let Fred Durst get away with his version of "music", buy some Beatles or AC/DC instead.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I hate wasting money... and I really hate Microsoft for not taking care of us with RROD's...  I've gone through 4 RROD's on past models and still have one working Elite.  I'm knocking on wood it still works.I do like this new model...  so far so good.  Kinect?  ehhh... it's not that fun to me.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Luke by Fisher-Price is a well-made toy and my grandson was very happy to add it to our growing collection of Thomas' engine friends!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is well made, runs smoothly and provides many hours of fun and entertainment.  I recommend using an official Xbox 360 controller to play it, connected to your PC.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

I recently got this for a family game night with my kids, ages 5 and 7, and this game was a HUGE hit! I love that we can now find games that my husband and I actually really enjoy playing with them. This is going to be a family favorite for a long time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This chalk came carefully packaged and none of the chalk was broken.  My son loves drawing on his blackboard.  I found nothing negative about the chalk or the shipping.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We've had this toy for about 6 months, and it's been played with daily since we bought it. My kids especially seem to like the animal sounds it makes,	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Great for younger kids. My 3 year old loves it. Easy to assemble and fun to use. Kids like the ice cream theme. Need to buy more for my other children.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Great gift.  Both my 3 and 5 year old grandsons love this toy. They have taken it apart and put it together several times. The 3 year old has no problem in reassembling it.  They also have the Loader.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter. It's super cute, but about half the length of a standard pen. (I didn't pay too close attention to the scale in the picture.)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This set of books is awesome.  My daughter has so much fun reading all these books with her tag reader.  Very encouraging product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I was really looking for just Howleen for my daughter, but this set of two was a nice price. She already has several versions of the Clawdeen Wolf, but she will be happy with another. Clawdeen is much harder to find, so I was happy to score this set for Christmas.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was purchased for my 10-month old grandson when he was sick. The pieces are nice and chunky and easy to put into place. The different sounds and activities of the pieces are entertaining.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My grandson loves this Lego set -- it's a motorcycle so what's not to love?  his daddy has one so makes it more special).  Super good price too for minifig & motorcycle.  Good set!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
